    **Features:**

    - *Named Entity Recognition (NER)* â€” Identifies and categorizes named entities in text (people, organizations, locations, dates, quantities).
    - *Key Phrase Extraction* â€” Extracts main concepts and topics from unstructured text to summarize subject matter.
    - *Sentiment Analysis* â€” Determines overall sentiment of text (positive, negative, neutral, mixed) and returns confidence scores.
    - *Language Detection* â€” Automatically detects the language of input text from supported languages.
    - *Entity Linking* â€” Disambiguates entities by linking them to entries in knowledge bases (provides contextual references).
    - *Personally Identifiable Information (PII) Detection* â€” Identifies and redacts sensitive data (credit cards, SSNs, emails, phone numbers).
    - *Text Analytics for Health* â€” Extracts clinical and medical entities (medications, diagnoses, symptoms, treatments) from health documents.
    - *Conversational Language Understanding (CLU)* â€” Builds custom NLU models to extract intents and entities for chatbots and voice assistants.
    - *Question Answering* â€” Creates knowledge bases from documents/FAQs to answer user questions (QA and retrieval-augmented scenarios).
    - *Custom Named Entity Recognition (Custom NER)* â€” Trains domain-specific entity extractors for business- or industry-specific entities.
    - *Custom Text Classification* â€” Builds models to categorize text into user-defined labels for routing or organization.
    - *Text Summarization* â€” Generates concise summaries from long documents (extractive or abstractive approaches).
    - *Opinion Mining* â€” Analyzes sentiment at a granular level by identifying aspects (targets) and opinions expressed about them.

### Exercise 2: Understand Responsible AI Principles

**Objective:** Learn the six core principles of responsible AI.

**The Six Principles:**

1. **Fairness**
   - AI systems should treat all people fairly
   - Avoid reinforcing unfair bias
   - Example: A hiring AI should not discriminate based on gender or race

2. **Reliability and Safety**
   - AI should perform reliably and safely
   - Handle unexpected situations gracefully
   - Example: An autonomous vehicle must safely handle edge cases

3. **Privacy and Security**
   - AI should secure data and respect privacy
   - Implement data protection and access controls
   - Example: A health AI must comply with HIPAA regulations

4. **Inclusiveness**
   - AI should empower everyone and engage people
   - Consider diverse user needs (accessibility, cultural sensitivity)
   - Example: Voice assistants should understand diverse accents

5. **Transparency**
   - AI should be understandable (explainable AI)
   - Users should understand how decisions are made
   - Example: A loan approval AI should explain rejection reasons

6. **Accountability**
   - People should be accountable for AI systems
   - Clear governance and oversight
   - Example: Designate responsible parties for AI system outcomes

**Activity:**

- For each principle, identify a real-world AI scenario where it applies
- Discuss potential consequences of violating each principle

### Exercise 3: Case Study Analysis

**Objective:** Apply responsible AI principles to real-world scenarios.

**Case Study 1: Healthcare Diagnosis AI**

A hospital wants to deploy an AI system to assist doctors in diagnosing diseases from medical images.

**Questions:**

1. Which responsible AI principles are most critical for this scenario?
2. What could go wrong if the AI is biased or unreliable?
3. How can transparency be achieved in this context?
4. Who should be accountable if the AI makes an incorrect diagnosis?

**Case Study 2: Hiring Recommendation System**

A company builds an AI to screen job applications and recommend candidates for interviews.

**Questions:**

1. What fairness concerns exist in this scenario?
2. How can the company ensure the AI doesn't discriminate?
3. What data privacy considerations apply?
4. Should candidates be informed that AI is used in screening?

**Case Study 3: Content Moderation AI**

A social media platform uses AI to detect and remove harmful content.

**Questions:**

1. How can the AI balance safety with freedom of expression?
2. What inclusiveness considerations exist (cultural differences, languages)?
3. How should the platform handle false positives (legitimate content flagged as harmful)?
4. Who is accountable for moderation decisions?

**Deliverables:**

- Written analysis for each case study
- Proposed mitigation strategies for identified risks
- Recommended governance framework
