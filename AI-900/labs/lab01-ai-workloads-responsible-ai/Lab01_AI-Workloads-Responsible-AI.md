### Exercise 2: Understand Responsible AI Principles

**Objective:** Learn the six core principles of responsible AI.

**The Six Principles:**

1. **Fairness**
   - AI systems should treat all people fairly
   - Avoid reinforcing unfair bias
   - Example: A hiring AI should not discriminate based on gender or race

2. **Reliability and Safety**
   - AI should perform reliably and safely
   - Handle unexpected situations gracefully
   - Example: An autonomous vehicle must safely handle edge cases

3. **Privacy and Security**
   - AI should secure data and respect privacy
   - Implement data protection and access controls
   - Example: A health AI must comply with HIPAA regulations

4. **Inclusiveness**
   - AI should empower everyone and engage people
   - Consider diverse user needs (accessibility, cultural sensitivity)
   - Example: Voice assistants should understand diverse accents

5. **Transparency**
   - AI should be understandable (explainable AI)
   - Users should understand how decisions are made
   - Example: A loan approval AI should explain rejection reasons

6. **Accountability**
   - People should be accountable for AI systems
   - Clear governance and oversight
   - Example: Designate responsible parties for AI system outcomes

**Activity:**

- For each principle, identify a real-world AI scenario where it applies
