### Exercise 2: Understand Responsible AI Principles

**Objective:** Learn the six core principles of responsible AI.

[What is Responsible AI?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/concept-responsible-ai?view=azureml-api-2)
[Responsible AI Standard](https://msblogs.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/5/2022/06/Microsoft-Responsible-AI-Standard-v2-General-Requirements-3.pdf)

**The Six Principles:**

1. **Fairness**
   - AI systems should treat all people fairly
   - Avoid reinforcing unfair bias
   - Example: A hiring AI should not discriminate based on gender or race

2. **Reliability and Safety**
   - AI should perform reliably and safely
   - Handle unexpected situations gracefully
   - Example: An autonomous vehicle must safely handle edge cases

3. **Privacy and Security**
   - AI should secure data and respect privacy
   - Implement data protection and access controls
   - Example: A health AI must comply with HIPAA regulations

4. **Inclusiveness**
   - AI should empower everyone and engage people
   - Consider diverse user needs (accessibility, cultural sensitivity)
   - Example: Voice assistants should understand diverse accents

5. **Transparency**
   - AI should be understandable (explainable AI)
   - Users should understand how decisions are made
   - Example: A loan approval AI should explain rejection reasons

6. **Accountability**
   - People should be accountable for AI systems
   - Clear governance and oversight
   - Example: Designate responsible parties for AI system outcomes

**Case Study 3: Content Moderation AI**

A social media platform uses AI to detect and remove harmful content.

**Questions:**

1. How can the AI balance safety with freedom of expression?
2. What inclusiveness considerations exist (cultural differences, languages)?
3. How should the platform handle false positives (legitimate content flagged as harmful)?
4. Who is accountable for moderation decisions?

**Deliverables:**

- Written analysis for each case study
- Proposed mitigation strategies for identified risks
- Recommended governance framework
