### Exercise 1: Understand Machine Learning Techniques

**Objective:** Learn to identify different types of machine learning problems.

Types of machine learning models:

<img src='images/2025-10-20-05-07-55.png' width=700>

**Overview of Machine Learning Types:**

- **Supervised Learning:** The model learns from labeled data where both input features and correct outputs (labels) are provided. The algorithm learns patterns to map inputs to outputs. Used for regression and classification tasks.

- **Unsupervised Learning:** The model finds patterns and structure in unlabeled data without predefined outputs. The algorithm discovers hidden relationships on its own. Used for clustering and dimensionality reduction.

- **Reinforcement Learning:** The model learns through trial and error by interacting with an environment. It receives rewards or penalties for actions and learns to maximize cumulative rewards. Used in robotics, game AI, and autonomous systems.

**1. Regression (Predict a Numeric Value)**  

- **Goal:** Predict a continuous numeric value
- **Examples:**
  - Predict house prices based on size, location, bedrooms
  - Forecast sales revenue based on marketing spend
  - Estimate patient recovery time based on treatment and demographics
- **Output:** A number (e.g., $250,000, 15 days, 42.5 units)

**2. Classification (Predict a Category)**  

- **Goal:** Predict which category or class something belongs to
- **Examples:**
  - Is this email spam or not spam? (binary classification)
  - Which animal is in this image: cat, dog, or bird? (multi-class classification)
  - Will a customer churn? (yes/no)
- **Output:** A category or label (e.g., "spam", "cat", "yes")
  
- **Goal:** Find groups of similar items without predefined labels (unsupervised learning)
- **Examples:**
  - Customer segmentation based on purchase behavior
  - Group similar articles or documents
  - Anomaly detection (items that don't fit any cluster)
- **Output:** Cluster assignments (e.g., Cluster 1, Cluster 2, Cluster 3)

**üîç Key Difference: Clustering vs. Multiclass Classification**

While both clustering and multiclass classification group items into categories, they differ fundamentally:

- **Multiclass Classification (Supervised):**
  - You already know the classes/categories beforehand (e.g., cat, dog, bird)
  - Training data includes labeled examples showing which class each item belongs to
  - The algorithm learns the relationship between features and known labels
  - Used to predict which predefined class a new item belongs to

- **Clustering (Unsupervised):**
  - No predefined classes or labels exist
  - The algorithm discovers natural groupings based purely on similarity of features
  - Groups are formed without prior knowledge of what the groups should be
  - Often used to discover what categories exist before building a classification model

**Example:** If you have photos labeled as "cat," "dog," or "bird," you'd use **classification**. If you have unlabeled photos and want to discover natural groupings (without knowing what those groups are), you'd use **clustering**.

**Activity:**

For each scenario below, identify if it's regression, classification, or clustering:

1. Predict tomorrow's temperature - **regression** ‚úÖ
   - *Correct! Temperature is a continuous numeric value (e.g., 72.5¬∞F). Regression predicts numbers.*

2. Group customers by purchasing patterns - **clustering** ‚úÖ
   - *Correct! This is unsupervised learning discovering natural groupings without predefined categories.*

3. Determine if a transaction is fraudulent - **classification** ‚úÖ
   - *Correct! Binary classification with two categories: fraudulent or not fraudulent (yes/no).*

4. Estimate delivery time for a package - **regression** ‚úÖ
   - *Correct! Delivery time is a numeric value (e.g., 2.5 days, 48 hours). Regression predicts continuous values.*

5. Segment website visitors into personas - **clustering** ‚úÖ
   - *Correct! Unsupervised learning discovering visitor segments based on behavior without predefined personas.*

### Exercise 2: Core Machine Learning Concepts

**Objective:** Understand the fundamental concepts used in machine learning.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Features:** Input variables (columns) used to make predictions (e.g., square footage, bedrooms, location)
- **Labels:** The target variable you want to predict (e.g., house price) ‚Äî only in supervised learning
- **Training dataset:** Data used to teach the model (typically 70-80% of total data)
- **Validation dataset:** Data used to tune and evaluate the model during training (10-15%)
- **Test dataset:** Held-out data used for final performance evaluation (10-15%)
- **Model:** The mathematical representation learned from data
- **Inference:** Using the trained model to make predictions on new data

**Activity:**

Given a dataset of house sales with columns: `SquareFeet`, `Bedrooms`, `Bathrooms`, `Location`, `YearBuilt`, `SalePrice`:

1. **Which columns are features?** - `SquareFeet`, `Bedrooms`, `Bathrooms`, `Location`, `YearBuilt` ‚úÖ
   - *Correct! Features are the input variables (independent variables) used to make predictions. They provide information about each house that helps the model learn patterns.*

2. **Which column is the label?** - `SalePrice` ‚úÖ
   - *Correct! The label (also called target variable or dependent variable) is what you're trying to predict. In supervised learning, this is the "answer" that the model learns to predict based on the features.*

3. **Is this a regression or classification problem?** - Regression ‚úÖ
   - *Correct! Since `SalePrice` is a continuous numeric value (like $250,000 or $375,500), this is a regression problem. Classification would be used if you were predicting categories (like "affordable," "moderate," "expensive").*

4. **How would you split the data for training, validation, and testing?** - Use a **70/15/15 split**:
   - **Training Set (70%):** Used to train the model and learn patterns between features and sale prices
   - **Validation Set (15%):** Used to tune the model, compare different algorithms, and select the best performing model during training
   - **Test Set (15%):** Held completely separate until the end to evaluate final model performance on unseen data
   - **Important:** Shuffle the data randomly before splitting to avoid any ordering bias in the original dataset

   *Alternative common splits: 80/10/10 or 60/20/20 (for smaller datasets). The key principle is to reserve separate data for validation (model tuning) and testing (final evaluation) to ensure the model generalizes well to new, unseen data.*

### Exercise 4: Understand Deep Learning and Transformers

**Objective:** Learn about advanced machine learning techniques.

[Deep learning vs machine learning in Azure Machine Learning](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/concept-deep-learning-vs-machine-learning?view=azureml-api-2)

**AI, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning ‚Äî Relationship (per Microsoft docs):**

- Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the broad field of building systems that perform tasks requiring human-like intelligence (reasoning, perception, decision-making).
- Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI where systems learn patterns from data instead of relying only on hand-crafted rules.
- Deep Learning (DL) is a subset of ML that uses deep neural networks to automatically learn representations, excelling with large amounts of data and unstructured inputs (images, audio, text).
- Inclusion relationship: AI ‚äÉ ML ‚äÉ DL. Not every AI solution uses ML, and not every ML problem needs DL. DL often provides higher accuracy on unstructured data but typically requires more data, compute, and may be less interpretable.

**Generative AI ‚Äî Where it fits (per Microsoft docs):**

- Generative AI is an application area within AI that focuses on creating new content (text, images, code, audio).
- It is typically powered by deep learning‚Äìbased generative models (e.g., Transformers for LLMs, diffusion models, GANs, VAEs), so it largely sits inside DL ‚äÇ ML ‚äÇ AI.
- Not all DL is generative; many DL models are discriminative. Generative AI emphasizes content creation, while discriminative models focus on prediction/classification.
- In Azure, services like Azure OpenAI provide generative models built on Transformer architectures.

**Deep Learning:**

- Uses neural networks with multiple layers (hence "deep")
- Excels at image, speech, and text processing
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** Specialized for images
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):** Specialized for sequences (text, time series)
- Requires large amounts of data and computational power

**Transfer Learning (per Microsoft docs):**

- Reuse a model pre-trained on a large dataset and adapt it to a new, related task instead of training from scratch.
- Two common approaches:
  - Feature extraction: freeze earlier layers as generic feature extractors, train a new classifier head.
  - Fine-tuning: unfreeze some/all layers and continue training on your task data.
- Benefits: requires less labeled data and compute, converges faster, and often improves accuracy when data is limited.
- Typical use cases: computer vision (e.g., adapting ImageNet-trained CNNs), NLP (e.g., adapting BERT/GPT), and speech.
- In Azure Machine Learning, you can build transfer learning workflows using pre-trained models and fine-tuning within your training pipelines.

**Types of Artificial Neural Networks (per Microsoft docs):**

- Feedforward (DNN/MLP): stacked fully connected layers; strong baseline for tabular data; no recurrence or convolution.
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): use convolutions/pooling to learn spatial features; excel on images and video.
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): model sequences and time dependencies; LSTM/GRU variants mitigate vanishing gradients.
- Autoencoders/VAEs: encoder‚Äìdecoder nets that learn compact representations; used for denoising, compression, anomaly detection.
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): generator vs discriminator setup for content synthesis (e.g., images), data augmentation.
- Transformers: attention-based sequence models that scale well; foundation for LLMs and many generative AI workloads.

**CNNs vs RNNs ‚Äî Key Differences (exam)**

- Data structure and inductive bias:
  - CNNs: exploit spatial locality with shared kernels and pooling; translation invariance on grid-like data (images/video).
  - RNNs: exploit temporal order with recurrent connections; model dependencies across time steps.
- Parallelism and training:
  - CNNs: highly parallelizable across spatial dimensions; typically faster to train on modern hardware.
  - RNNs: inherently sequential across time steps; slower and harder to parallelize.
- Context modeling:
  - CNNs: strong at local patterns via receptive fields; use depth/dilation to expand context.
  - RNNs: better for sequence dependencies; LSTM/GRU mitigate vanishing gradients for longer-range context.
- Variable-length handling:
  - CNNs: usually require fixed-size windows/padding or global pooling.
  - RNNs: naturally handle variable-length sequences.
- Typical use cases:
  - CNNs: image classification, object detection, segmentation, video tasks.
  - RNNs: language modeling, sequence labeling (NER), time-series forecasting, speech.
- Outputs:
  - CNNs: produce feature maps; add fully connected head for classification/regression.
  - RNNs: produce hidden states per step or a final summary state; suited for seq-to-seq and sequence tagging.
- Note: 1D CNNs can work on sequences, and Transformers increasingly replace RNNs for many NLP tasks.

**Transformer Architecture:**

[Understand the transformer architecture used for natural language processing (NLP)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/explore-foundation-models-in-model-catalog/4-transformers)

- Modern architecture that revolutionized NLP
- Uses "attention mechanisms" to understand context
- Foundation for models like BERT, GPT, T5
- Powers Azure OpenAI Service models

**Transformer Architecture ‚Äî Detailed Overview:**

Transformers are a breakthrough deep learning architecture introduced in 2017 that revolutionized natural language processing and other AI domains.

**Key Components:**

- **Self-Attention Mechanism:** The core innovation that allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in a sequence relative to each other, regardless of their distance. This enables understanding of long-range dependencies and context.

- **Parallel Processing:** Unlike RNNs that process sequences step-by-step, transformers process entire sequences simultaneously, making them much faster to train and more scalable.

- **Encoder-Decoder Architecture:**
  - **Encoder:** Processes input sequences and creates contextual representations
  - **Decoder:** Generates output sequences based on encoder representations
  - Some models use only encoders (BERT) or only decoders (GPT)

- **Positional Encoding:** Since transformers don't process sequences in order, positional information is added to help the model understand word order.

**Foundation Models:**

Large pre-trained transformer models that serve as the basis for many AI applications:

- **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers):** Understands context from both directions, excellent for classification and question answering
- **GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer):** Specializes in text generation and completion
- **T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer):** Treats all NLP tasks as text-to-text problems

**Applications Beyond NLP:**

- **Vision Transformers (ViT):** Apply transformer architecture to image processing
- **Code generation:** Models like GitHub Copilot use transformer-based architectures
- **Multimodal models:** Combine text, images, and other data types

**Benefits:**

- Better handling of long-range dependencies in text
- Parallel processing enables faster training
- Transfer learning through pre-training on large datasets
- Versatility across multiple tasks without architecture changes
- Foundation for modern large language models (LLMs)

**Azure Integration:**

- Available through Azure Machine Learning Model Catalog
- Powers Azure OpenAI Service (GPT-4, GPT-3.5, etc.)
- Can be deployed and fine-tuned using Azure ML services

**Activity:**

1. **Research one real-world application of CNNs**

   **Medical Image Analysis - Diabetic Retinopathy Detection:** CNNs analyze retinal photographs to detect diabetic retinopathy (eye disease). Google's DeepMind system processes retinal scans using convolutional layers to identify blood vessel patterns, hemorrhages, and lesions, classifying disease severity. CNNs excel here because they automatically learn hierarchical visual features and maintain spatial relationships critical for identifying disease markers in specific retinal locations. Deployed in clinics worldwide, achieving accuracy comparable to human ophthalmologists.

2. **Research one real-world application of Transformers**

   **GitHub Copilot - AI-Powered Code Completion:** GitHub Copilot uses OpenAI's Codex (transformer-based) to suggest code completions and entire functions in real-time. Built on GPT architecture and trained on billions of lines of code, it uses self-attention to understand code context across multiple programming languages. Transformers excel here because they understand long-range dependencies in code (e.g., variables defined many lines earlier), handle multiple languages with one architecture, and generate coherent multi-line code blocks. Studies show it increases developer productivity by 55%.

3. **Explain why Transformers are well-suited for language understanding**

   Transformers excel at language understanding due to:
   - **Self-Attention Mechanism:** Weighs importance of every word relative to every other word, capturing contextual meaning (e.g., "bank" in "river bank" vs. "bank account")
   - **Bidirectional Context:** Models like BERT read text in both directions simultaneously, understanding pronouns and references across long distances
   - **Parallel Processing:** Processes entire sentences at once (unlike sequential RNNs), enabling faster training and better long-range dependency capture
   - **Positional Encoding:** Maintains word order while processing in parallel (understanding "dog bites man" ‚â† "man bites dog")
   - **Transfer Learning:** Pre-trained on massive text corpora, learning grammar, semantics, and world knowledge before fine-tuning for specific tasks

   **Example:** In "The trophy doesn't fit in the brown suitcase because it's too large," transformers use self-attention to determine "it" refers to "trophy" (not "suitcase") based on "too large," processing all relationships in parallel.

## üß† Knowledge Check

1. **What is the difference between regression and classification?**

   **Answer:** Regression predicts continuous numeric values (e.g., house prices, temperatures), while classification predicts discrete categories or classes (e.g., spam/not spam, cat/dog/bird). Regression outputs numbers; classification outputs labels.

2. **Is clustering supervised or unsupervised learning?**

   **Answer:** Clustering is unsupervised learning. It discovers natural groupings in data without predefined labels or categories, finding patterns based purely on feature similarity.

3. **What is the purpose of a validation dataset?**

   **Answer:** The validation dataset is used during training to tune model hyperparameters, compare different algorithms, and select the best performing model. It helps prevent overfitting by providing feedback on model performance on data it hasn't trained on, without compromising the test set.

4. **What does AutoML do?**

   **Answer:** AutoML (Automated Machine Learning) automatically tries multiple algorithms, feature engineering techniques, and hyperparameters to find the best model for your data. It eliminates manual trial-and-error, making machine learning accessible without deep expertise in algorithm selection and tuning.

5. **Name two types of deep learning architectures.**

   **Answer:**
   - **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** Specialized for processing grid-like data such as images and video
   - **Transformers:** Use self-attention mechanisms for processing sequences, foundation for modern NLP models like GPT and BERT

   *Other valid answers: RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks), GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks), Autoencoders*

6. **What is the Transformer architecture used for?**

   **Answer:** Transformers are primarily used for natural language processing tasks including text generation, translation, question answering, and sentiment analysis. They also power modern applications like ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and Azure OpenAI Service. Beyond NLP, Vision Transformers (ViT) apply the architecture to image processing and multimodal models combine text, images, and other data types.
