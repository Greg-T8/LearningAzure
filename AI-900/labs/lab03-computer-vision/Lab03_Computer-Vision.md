## ðŸ§ª Lab Exercises

### Exercise 1: Image Analysis with Azure AI Vision

**Objective:** Analyze images to extract tags, captions, and objects.

**Steps:**

1. **Create Azure AI Vision Resource:**
   - Navigate to Azure Portal
   - Create resource: "Computer Vision" or "Azure AI services"
   - Note the endpoint URL and API key

2. **Test Image Analysis (Portal):**
   - In the resource overview, click "Try it out" or "Quick start"
   - Upload a sample image or use a URL
   - Review detected:
     - Tags (keywords describing the image)
     - Captions (generated descriptions)
     - Objects (detected items with bounding boxes)
     - Colors, brands, faces

3. **Test via REST API or SDK (Optional):**
   - Use Python SDK or cURL to call the Analyze Image API
   - Extract tags, captions, and objects programmatically

**Sample Images to Try:**

- Street scene with cars and pedestrians
- Retail store with products on shelves
- Landscape with mountains and trees
- Food on a plate

**Deliverables:**

- Screenshot of analysis results for 2-3 images
- List of detected tags and objects
- Discussion: How accurate were the results?

### Exercise 2: Optical Character Recognition (OCR)

**Objective:** Extract text from images and documents using the Read API.

**Steps:**

1. **Use the Read API:**
   - In the Azure AI Vision resource, navigate to OCR features
   - Test the Read API with a sample document image
   - Try different types of documents:
     - Scanned book page
     - Handwritten note
     - Receipt or invoice
     - Street sign

2. **Review Extracted Text:**
   - Examine the extracted text
   - Note confidence scores
   - Check for errors or misreads

3. **Test via SDK (Optional):**
   - Use Python or C# SDK to extract text programmatically
   - Process the results (e.g., search for specific keywords)

**Deliverables:**

- Screenshot of OCR results
- Accuracy assessment (were there any errors?)
- Discussion: When would OCR be useful in a business context?

### Exercise 3: Facial Detection and Analysis with Azure AI Face

**Objective:** Detect faces and analyze facial attributes.

**Steps:**

1. **Create Azure AI Face Resource:**
   - Navigate to Azure Portal
   - Create resource: "Face" service
   - Note the endpoint URL and API key

2. **Test Face Detection (Portal):**
   - Use the Face API test interface
   - Upload an image with one or more faces
   - Review detected:
     - Face bounding boxes
     - Landmarks (eyes, nose, mouth)
     - Attributes (age estimate, emotion, glasses, facial hair, etc.)

3. **Experiment with Different Images:**
   - Single person
   - Group photo
   - Profile view vs. frontal view
   - Different lighting conditions

**Important Note:**

- Face identification (recognizing specific individuals) requires additional setup and has strict usage policies
- This lab focuses on detection and attribute analysis only

**Deliverables:**

- Screenshot of face detection results
- List of detected attributes for each face
- Discussion: What are ethical considerations when using facial analysis?

### Exercise 4: Understand When to Use Each Service

**Objective:** Learn which Azure computer vision service to use for different scenarios.

**Service Comparison:**

| Scenario | Service | Feature |
|----------|---------|---------|
| Categorize images into predefined classes | Azure AI Vision | Image Classification |
| Detect and locate multiple objects in an image | Azure AI Vision | Object Detection |
| Extract text from scanned documents | Azure AI Vision | Read API (OCR) |
| Detect faces in a photo | Azure AI Face | Face Detection |
| Estimate age and emotion from faces | Azure AI Face | Face Attributes |
| Recognize specific individuals | Azure AI Face | Face Identification |
| Train a custom image classifier | Azure AI Vision | Custom Vision |

**Activity:**

For each scenario, choose the correct service and feature:

1. A retail store wants to count customers entering the store
2. A library wants to digitize old books
3. A security system needs to verify employee identity
4. A social media app wants to tag objects in user photos
5. A research study needs to analyze emotional expressions

## ðŸ§  Knowledge Check

1. What is the difference between image classification and object detection?
2. Which Azure service would you use to extract text from a PDF?
3. What attributes can Azure AI Face detect?
4. When would you use Custom Vision instead of the standard Azure AI Vision service?
5. What are ethical considerations when using facial analysis technology?
