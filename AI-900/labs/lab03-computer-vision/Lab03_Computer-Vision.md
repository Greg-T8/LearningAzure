| Recognize specific individuals | Azure AI Face | Face Identification |
| Train a custom image classifier | Azure AI Vision | [Custom Vision](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/custom-vision-service/overview) |

**Activity:**

For each scenario, choose the correct service and feature:

1. A retail store wants to count customers entering the store
2. A library wants to digitize old books
3. A security system needs to verify employee identity
4. A social media app wants to tag objects in user photos
5. A research study needs to analyze emotional expressions
