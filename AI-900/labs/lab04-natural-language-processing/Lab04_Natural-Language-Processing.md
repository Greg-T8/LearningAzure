     - Neutral statement: "The package arrived on Tuesday."
   - Review sentiment scores (positive, negative, neutral)

3. **Test Entity Recognition (NER):**
   - Analyze text to extract named entities:
     - People: "John Smith works at Microsoft."
     - Organizations: "Apple announced a new iPhone."
     - Locations: "I'm traveling to Paris next month."
     - Dates: "The meeting is on October 20, 2025."
   - Review entity types and confidence scores

4. **Test Key Phrase Extraction:**
   - Extract main topics from longer text:
     - News article
     - Customer review
     - Email or document
   - Identify key phrases that summarize the content

**Sample Text to Analyze:**

> "Microsoft announced the release of Azure OpenAI Service in November 2023. The service provides access to powerful language models like GPT-4 and DALL-E 3. Customers can deploy these models in their own Azure subscriptions for enhanced security and compliance. Early feedback has been overwhelmingly positive."

**Deliverables:**

- Screenshot of sentiment analysis results
- List of extracted entities with types
- Key phrases identified
- Discussion: How could this be used in a customer service context?

- [Try Speech Studio](https://speech.microsoft.com/)

**Steps:**

1. **Create Azure AI Speech Resource:**
   - Navigate to Azure Portal
   - Create resource: "Speech" service
   - Note the endpoint and API key

2. **Test Speech-to-Text (Recognition):**
   - Use Speech Studio or SDK
   - Upload an audio file or use microphone
   - Review transcribed text
   - Test with:
     - Clear speech
     - Background noise
     - Different accents

3. **Test Text-to-Speech (Synthesis):**
   - Convert text to spoken audio
   - Experiment with:
     - Different voices (male, female)
     - Different languages
     - Speech rate and pitch
   - Download the generated audio

4. **Test Speech Translation (Optional):**
   - Translate spoken audio to text in another language
   - Example: Speak in English, get Spanish text output

**Deliverables:**

- Screenshot of speech-to-text transcription
- Audio file generated from text-to-speech
- Accuracy assessment: Were there transcription errors?

**Concepts:**

- **Intent:** What the user wants to do (e.g., "BookFlight", "CheckWeather", "CancelOrder")
- **Entity:** Key information extracted from the utterance (e.g., "Seattle" as a location, "tomorrow" as a date)
- **Utterance:** What the user says (e.g., "Book a flight to Seattle tomorrow")

**Activity (Conceptual):**

Design a simple language understanding model for a pizza ordering bot:

1. **Intents:**
   - OrderPizza
   - CheckOrderStatus
   - CancelOrder

2. **Entities:**
   - PizzaSize (small, medium, large)
   - Toppings (pepperoni, mushrooms, olives)
   - Quantity (1, 2, 3)

3. **Sample Utterances:**
   - "I want to order a large pepperoni pizza"
   - "Can I get two medium pizzas with mushrooms?"
   - "What's the status of my order?"

4. **Design Exercise:**
   - Write 5 sample utterances for each intent
   - Identify which entities should be extracted
   - Discuss how the bot would respond to each intent

**Deliverables:**

- Intent and entity design document
- Sample utterances for each intent
- Discussion: How would you train this model in Azure Language Studio?
