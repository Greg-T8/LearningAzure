## ðŸ§ª Lab Exercises

### Exercise 1: Explore Azure OpenAI Service Models

**Objective:** Understand the capabilities of different Azure OpenAI models.

**Available Models:**

1. **GPT-4 and GPT-4 Turbo:**
   - Most capable language model
   - Excellent for complex reasoning, content creation, code generation
   - Supports large context windows (up to 128K tokens)
   - Higher cost, slower than GPT-3.5

2. **GPT-3.5 Turbo:**
   - Fast and cost-effective
   - Good for most common tasks (chatbots, summarization, simple Q&A)
   - Smaller context window (4K-16K tokens)

3. **DALL-E 3:**
   - Image generation from text descriptions
   - Creates photorealistic or artistic images
   - Example prompt: "A futuristic cityscape at sunset with flying cars"

4. **Whisper:**
   - Speech-to-text (transcription)
   - Highly accurate, supports multiple languages
   - Can handle noisy audio

5. **Embeddings (text-embedding-ada-002):**
   - Convert text to vector representations
   - Used for semantic search, recommendations, clustering
   - Enable finding similar documents or passages

**Activity:**

For each scenario, choose the best model:

1. Build a customer support chatbot
2. Generate marketing images for a product launch
3. Transcribe a podcast episode
4. Write complex technical documentation
5. Search through thousands of support tickets to find similar issues

### Exercise 2: Use Azure AI Foundry (Prompt Engineering)

**Objective:** Learn to build and test generative AI solutions using Azure AI Foundry.

**Steps:**

1. **Navigate to Azure AI Foundry:**
   - Go to [Azure AI Foundry portal](https://ai.azure.com)
   - Sign in with your Azure account
   - Create a new project

2. **Access the Playground:**
   - Navigate to the "Playground" section
   - Select a deployed GPT model (GPT-4 or GPT-3.5)
   - Configure system message and parameters

3. **System Message (Prompt Engineering):**
   - The system message sets the AI's behavior and role
   - Example: "You are a helpful AI assistant for a customer support team. Be professional, concise, and friendly."

4. **Test Different Prompts:**

   **Example 1: Content Generation**
   - Prompt: "Write a professional email to a customer explaining a product delay."
   - Adjust tone, length, formality

   **Example 2: Code Generation**
   - Prompt: "Write a Python function to calculate the Fibonacci sequence."
   - Test with different languages (JavaScript, C#)

   **Example 3: Data Extraction**
   - Prompt: "Extract the name, email, and phone number from this text: [sample unstructured text]"
   - Review JSON output

   **Example 4: Summarization**
   - Prompt: "Summarize this article in 3 bullet points: [paste long article]"
   - Test with different lengths

5. **Adjust Parameters:**
   - **Temperature (0-2):** Higher = more creative/random, Lower = more focused/deterministic
   - **Top P (0-1):** Alternative to temperature for controlling randomness
   - **Max tokens:** Limits response length
   - **Frequency penalty:** Reduces repetition

**Deliverables:**

- Screenshots of 3-4 different prompt results
- Discussion: How did changing temperature affect the output?
- Best practices for writing effective prompts

---

### Exercise 3: Explore Azure AI Foundry Model Catalog

**Objective:** Understand the variety of models available beyond Azure OpenAI.

**Steps:**

1. **Navigate to Model Catalog:**
   - In Azure AI Foundry, go to "Model catalog"
   - Browse available models from:
     - Microsoft (Phi-3, Florence)
     - OpenAI (GPT, DALL-E)
     - Meta (Llama)
     - Hugging Face (various open-source models)
     - Mistral, Cohere, and others

2. **Compare Models:**
   - Review model cards with capabilities, limitations, and use cases
   - Compare:
     - Model size (parameters)
     - Context window
     - Supported tasks (chat, completion, embeddings)
     - Pricing

3. **Deploy a Model (Optional):**
   - Select a model and deploy as a managed endpoint
   - Test the endpoint with sample prompts

**Deliverables:**

- Comparison table of 3 models
- Discussion: When would you choose Llama 3 over GPT-4?

### Exercise 4: Apply Responsible AI to Generative AI

**Objective:** Implement responsible AI practices for generative AI solutions.

**Responsible AI Considerations for Generative AI:**

1. **Content Filters:**
   - Azure OpenAI includes built-in filters for harmful content
   - Categories: hate, violence, sexual, self-harm
   - Configure filter severity (low, medium, high)

2. **Grounding with Data:**
   - Connect GPT to your own data (Retrieval-Augmented Generation - RAG)
   - Reduces hallucinations (made-up information)
   - Example: Ground chatbot answers in company documentation

3. **Bias and Fairness:**
   - LLMs can amplify biases in training data
   - Test for biased responses across demographics
   - Implement review processes

4. **Misinformation:**
   - LLMs can generate false or misleading information
   - Add disclaimers ("AI-generated content, verify facts")
   - Implement fact-checking processes

5. **Security:**
   - Prompt injection attacks (malicious prompts)
   - Data leakage (exposing training data or sensitive info)
   - Input validation and output monitoring

**Activity:**

1. **Test Content Filters:**
   - Try prompts that might trigger content filters
   - Review how the filters work

2. **Design a Responsible AI Framework:**
   - For a customer-facing chatbot, what safeguards would you implement?
   - How would you monitor for issues?
   - Who is accountable for AI-generated responses?

**Deliverables:**

- Responsible AI framework document
- List of potential risks and mitigation strategies

### Exercise 5: Build a Simple Chatbot (Optional)

**Objective:** Create a functional chatbot using Azure OpenAI and Azure AI Foundry.

**Steps:**

1. **Design the Chatbot:**
   - Define the chatbot's purpose (e.g., IT helpdesk, product recommendations)
   - Write a system message
   - Prepare sample questions

2. **Implement in Azure AI Foundry:**
   - Use the Chat playground
   - Configure system message and parameters
   - Test with sample conversations

3. **Add Context (RAG - Optional):**
   - Upload documents (FAQs, product manuals)
   - Enable "Add your data" feature
   - Test how the chatbot uses your data to answer questions

4. **Deploy (Optional):**
   - Deploy the chatbot as a web app
   - Test the deployed endpoint

**Deliverables:**

- System message and configuration
- Sample conversation logs
- Screenshot of chatbot responses
