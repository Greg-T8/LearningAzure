## AI Concepts in Azure AI Foundry

[Module Reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/get-started-ai-in-foundry/2-concepts)

**Purpose of Azure AI Foundry**

* Azure AI Foundry is a platform for building, customizing, and deploying AI solutions.
* It supports the full AI application lifecycle, from model selection to deployment and monitoring.
* Designed to help teams move from experimentation to production-ready AI.

**Core AI concepts**

* **AI models**: Mathematical models trained on data to perform tasks such as prediction, classification, or generation.
* **Foundation models**: Large, pre-trained models that can be adapted for many tasks without training from scratch.
* **Fine-tuning**: Customizing a pre-trained model with domain-specific data to improve task performance.
* **Prompting**: Providing structured input instructions to guide model behavior and outputs.

**Types of models supported**

* **Language models**: Process and generate text.
* **Vision models**: Analyze images and visual content.
* **Speech models**: Convert spoken language to text or generate speech.
* **Multi-modal models**: Combine multiple data types (for example, text and images) to produce richer outputs.

**Key platform capabilities**

* **Model catalog**: Browse and select models based on capability, cost, and performance.
* **Evaluation tools**: Test and compare model outputs.
* **Safety and governance controls**: Apply content filters and Responsible AI practices.
* **Deployment options**: Expose models through endpoints for application integration.

**How AI solutions are built**

* Choose an appropriate model for the workload.
* Configure prompts or fine-tuning based on requirements.
* Evaluate results and iterate.
* Deploy models to production endpoints.

**Exam-relevant points**

* Azure AI Foundry supports multiple AI workloads and model types.
* Foundation models reduce the need for training models from scratch.
* Prompting and fine-tuning are primary ways to adapt models.
* Multi-modal models are explicitly supported and exam-relevant.
