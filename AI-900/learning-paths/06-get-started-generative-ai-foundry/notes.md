## Understand generative AI applications

[Module Reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/get-started-generative-ai-azure/2-generative-ai)

**Generative AI applications**

* Built with **language models**
* Language models power the **app logic** that manages interactions between users and generative AI

**Assistants**

* Common form of generative AI presented as **chat-based assistants**
* Integrated into applications to help users **find information** and **perform tasks efficiently**
* **Microsoft Copilot**

  * A generative AI–based assistant integrated across Microsoft applications and experiences
  * **Business users** use it to improve productivity and creativity with AI-generated content and task automation
  * **Developers** can extend it by:

    * Creating plug-ins
    * Integrating Copilot with business processes and data
    * Building copilot-like agents for apps and services

**Agents**

* Generative AI systems that can **execute tasks autonomously**
* Can respond to user input or **assess situations and take actions**
* Designed to support **multi-step task execution**
* Example use case:

  * An executive assistant agent that:

    * Retrieves meeting location
    * Attaches a map
    * Automates taxi or rideshare booking

**Core components of agents**

* **Language model** – Powers reasoning and language understanding
* **Instructions** – Define goals, behavior, and constraints
* **Tools (functions)** – Enable task execution

**Orchestration**

* Modern AI solutions often combine:

  * Assistant capabilities
  * Agentic behaviors
  * Other AI components
* **Orchestration** is the coordination and management of:

  * Models
  * Data sources
  * Tools
  * Workflows
* Ensures multiple AI components work together in a unified solution

**Framework for generative AI applications**

* Generative AI applications can be grouped into **three categories**, increasing in customization:

| Category                                   | Description                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ready-to-use**                           | No programming required; users interact by asking questions                                        |
| **Extendable**                             | Ready-to-use applications that can be customized with user data to support business-specific tasks |
| **Applications built from the foundation** | Custom assistants and agents built directly from a language model                                  |

* **Microsoft Copilot** is both **ready-to-use** and **extendable**
* Common services used for extending or building applications:

  * **Copilot Studio** – Extends Microsoft 365 Copilot
  * **Microsoft Foundry** – Builds AI solutions using different models

**Key Facts to Remember**

* Generative AI applications are powered by **language models**
* **Assistants** focus on user interaction and task support
* **Agents** can act autonomously and complete multi-step tasks
* Agents require **models, instructions, and tools**
* **Orchestration** coordinates multiple AI components
* Generative AI applications fall into **three categories** based on customization level
