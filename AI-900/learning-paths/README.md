## Introduction to AI speech concepts – Speech recognition

[Module Reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/introduction-ai-speech/3-speech-recognition?pivots=text)

**Speech Recognition Overview**

- **Speech recognition (speech-to-text)** converts spoken language into written text.
- The pipeline consists of **six coordinated stages**:

  - Audio capture
  - Pre-processing
  - Acoustic modeling
  - Language modeling
  - Decoding
  - Post-processing

**Audio Capture**

- Converts **analog sound waves to digital signals** using a microphone.
- Typical sampling rate for speech:

  - **16,000 samples per second (16 kHz)**
- Sampling rate considerations:

  - Higher rates (e.g., **44.1 kHz**) capture more detail but increase processing cost.
  - Speech systems balance clarity and efficiency at **8–16 kHz**.
- Accuracy is affected by:

  - Background noise
  - Microphone quality
  - Distance from the speaker
- Basic filters may remove hums, clicks, and background noise before further processing.

**Pre-Processing**

- Transforms raw audio into compact, meaningful representations.
- Discards irrelevant details such as absolute volume.

**Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs)**

- **Most common feature extraction technique** in speech recognition.
- Mimics human hearing by emphasizing speech-relevant frequencies.
- **MFCC process**:

  1. Divide audio into overlapping **20–30 ms frames**
  2. Apply **Fourier transform** to convert time domain to frequency domain
  3. Map frequencies to the **Mel scale**
  4. Extract a small set of coefficients (commonly **13 coefficients**)
- Output is a **sequence of feature vectors**, one per frame.
- Each vector contains **13 MFCC values** representing spectral shape.

**Acoustic Modeling**

- Learns the relationship between audio features and **phonemes**.
- **Phonemes** are the smallest sound units distinguishing words.

  - English uses approximately **44 phonemes**
  - Example: *cat* → /k/, /æ/, /t/
- Modern systems use **transformer architectures**.
- Transformer characteristics:

  - **Attention mechanisms** use surrounding frames for context
  - **Parallel processing** improves speed and accuracy
  - **Contextualized predictions** learn common phoneme sequences
- Output is a **probability distribution over phonemes** for each frame.
- Phonemes are **language-specific** and require retraining for other languages.

**Language Modeling**

- Resolves ambiguity where phonemes alone are insufficient.
- Applies knowledge of:

  - Vocabulary
  - Grammar
  - Common word patterns
- Language model guidance includes:

  - **Statistical patterns** from training data
  - **Context awareness** based on prior words
  - **Domain adaptation** for specialized terminology

**Decoding**

- Searches for the word sequence that best matches acoustic and language models.
- Balances:

  - Fidelity to the audio signal
  - Readability and grammatical correctness
- **Beam search decoding**:

  - Maintains a shortlist of top-scoring hypotheses
  - Extends, scores, and prunes candidates at each step
- Evaluates **thousands of hypotheses** for short utterances.
- Decoding is **computationally intensive**.

  - Real-time systems limit beam width and hypothesis depth to reduce latency.

**Post-Processing**

- Refines raw decoded text for presentation.
- Common tasks:

  - **Capitalization**
  - **Punctuation restoration**
  - **Number formatting**
  - **Profanity filtering**
  - **Inverse text normalization**
  - **Confidence scoring**
- Azure Speech returns:

  - Final transcription
  - **Word-level timestamps**
  - **Confidence scores**

**End-to-End Pipeline Flow**

- Audio capture → raw signal
- Pre-processing → MFCC features
- Acoustic modeling → phoneme probabilities
- Language modeling → vocabulary and grammar context
- Decoding → best word sequence
- Post-processing → readable, formatted text

**Key Facts to Remember**

- **Six stages** make up the speech recognition pipeline
- Typical speech sampling rate: **16 kHz**
- MFCCs commonly extract **13 coefficients**
- Audio frames are **20–30 ms**
- English has approximately **44 phonemes**
- Transformers are used for modern acoustic modeling
- Beam search is the most common decoding technique
- Post-processing improves readability and usability

## Speech synthesis

[Module Reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/modules/introduction-to-ai-speech-concepts/)

**Overview**

- **Speech synthesis** (text-to-speech, TTS) converts written text into spoken audio.
- Used by virtual assistants, navigation apps, and accessibility tools.
- Systems transform text through **four distinct stages**, producing a natural audio waveform.

**Stage 1: Text normalization**

- Prepares raw text for pronunciation by converting it into spoken forms.
- Prevents pronunciation of raw symbols or digits.

*Common normalization tasks*

- Expanding abbreviations (for example, **“Dr.” → “Doctor”**, **“Inc.” → “Incorporated”**)

- Converting numbers to words (**“3” → “three”**, **“25.50” → “twenty-five dollars and fifty cents”**)

- Handling dates and times (**“12/15/2023” → “December fifteenth, two thousand twenty-three”**)

- Processing symbols and special characters (**“$” → “dollars”**, **“@” → “at”**)

- Resolving homographs based on context (**“read” present vs. past tense**)

- Domain-specific rules apply (for example, medical vs. financial text).

**Stage 2: Linguistic analysis**

- Maps normalized text to **phonemes** (smallest units of sound).
- Determines correct pronunciation based on context.

*Linguistic analysis tasks*

- Segmenting text into words and syllables
- Looking up pronunciations in lexicons
- Applying **grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P)** rules or neural models for unknown words
- Marking syllable boundaries and stressed syllables
- Determining phonetic context of adjacent sounds

**Grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion**

- Maps written letters to phonemes.
- Handles inconsistent spelling-to-sound mappings in languages like English.

*Examples*

- **though** → /θoʊ/

- **through** → /θruː/

- **cough** → /kɔːf/

- Modern G2P uses neural networks trained on pronunciation dictionaries.

- Context-aware models (often transformers) disambiguate pronunciation (for example, **“read”** in present vs. past tense).

**Stage 3: Prosody generation**

- Determines **how** words are spoken, not just which sounds are produced.
- Prosody affects naturalness and meaning.

*Elements of prosody*

- Pitch contours (rising/falling pitch)
- Duration (sound length and rhythm)
- Intensity (loudness)
- Pauses (phrase and sentence breaks)
- Stress patterns (syllable and word emphasis)

*Prosody impact*

- Emphasis placement can change sentence meaning.
- Flat prosody results in robotic-sounding speech.

**Transformer-based prosody prediction**

- Uses transformer neural networks to model sentence-level context.

*Prosody generation process*

1. **Input encoding**: Phoneme sequence plus linguistic features
2. **Contextual analysis**: Self-attention identifies relationships across the sentence
3. **Prosody prediction**: Pitch, duration, and energy per phoneme
4. **Style factors**: Speaking style and speaker characteristics

*Factors influencing prosody*

- Syntax

- Semantics

- Discourse context

- Speaker identity

- Emotional tone

- Output is a detailed target specification (pitch, duration, intensity, pauses).

**Stage 4: Speech synthesis (audio generation)**

- Generates the final audio waveform from phonemes and prosody.

*Waveform generation approaches*

- Uses **neural vocoders**.

*Common vocoder architectures*

- **WaveNet**
- **WaveGlow**
- **HiFi-GAN**

*Synthesis process*

1. **Acoustic feature generation**: Converts phonemes and prosody into mel-spectrograms
2. **Vocoding**: Converts mel-spectrograms into raw audio waveforms (16,000–48,000 samples/second)
3. **Post-processing**: Filtering, normalization, and audio effects

*Why neural vocoders are effective*

- High fidelity audio
- Natural-sounding speech
- Real-time generation
- Flexibility across speakers, languages, and styles

**Complete pipeline example**

- Input: **“Dr. Chen’s appointment is at 3:00 PM”**
- Text normalization: “Doctor Chen’s appointment is at three o’clock P M”
- Linguistic analysis: Converted to phoneme sequence
- Prosody generation: Emphasis and pauses predicted
- Speech synthesis: Audio waveform generated
- End-to-end process typically completes in **under one second** on modern hardware.

**Key Facts to Remember**

- **Speech synthesis has four stages**: text normalization, linguistic analysis, prosody generation, speech synthesis.
- **G2P conversion** handles inconsistent spelling-to-sound mappings.
- **Prosody** (pitch, stress, rhythm) is critical for natural-sounding speech.
- **Transformers** are used for both pronunciation context and prosody prediction.
- **Neural vocoders** generate high-quality, real-time audio waveforms.
