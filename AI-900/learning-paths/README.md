  * Voice assistants
  * Accessible applications
  * Conversational AI agents
* Understanding speech technologies is essential for modern AI solutions.

**Fundamental Speech Capabilities**

* **Speech recognition**

  * Converts **spoken words into text**
* **Speech synthesis**

  * Converts **text into natural-sounding speech**
* These two capabilities work together to enable **seamless voice interactions**.

**Learning Focus of the Module**

* How speech recognition and speech synthesis function
* How both technologies combine to power **voice-enabled applications**
* Real-world scenarios where speech technologies enhance user interaction

**Key Facts to Remember**

* **Speech recognition** = spoken language → text
* **Speech synthesis** = text → spoken language
* Speech technologies enable **intuitive, accessible, and engaging** AI experiences

- **E-learning and training**

  - Narrated lessons without recording studios
  - Pronunciation guidance
  - Multilingual audio content
  - **Business value**: Reduces costs and accelerates content creation.

- **Entertainment and media**

  - Character voices and voiceovers
  - Podcast and audiobook prototypes
  - Personalized audio experiences
  - **Business value**: Enables rapid prototyping and scalability.

**Combining Speech Recognition and Synthesis**

- **Voice-driven customer service**
- **Interactive voice response (IVR) systems**
- **Language learning applications**
- **Voice-controlled vehicles**

*Combined use enables fluid, two-way conversational experiences that reduce user friction.*

**Key Considerations Before Implementation**

- **Audio quality**: Noise, microphones, and bandwidth affect accuracy.
- **Language and dialect support**: Verify coverage for target audiences.
- **Privacy and compliance**: Understand audio data handling and protection.
- **Latency**: Real-time conversations require low latency.
- **Accessibility standards**: Must align with WCAG guidelines.
- **Alternative interfaces**: Always provide text-based input and output options.

**Key Facts to Remember**

- **Speech recognition** = speech-to-text.
- **Speech synthesis** = text-to-speech.
- Combining both enables conversational AI.
- Accessibility and alternative interfaces are mandatory considerations.
