## Introduction to AI speech concepts – Speech recognition

[Module Reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/introduction-ai-speech/3-speech-recognition?pivots=text)

**Speech Recognition Overview**

- **Speech recognition (speech-to-text)** converts spoken language into written text.
- The pipeline consists of **six coordinated stages**:

  - Audio capture
  - Pre-processing
  - Acoustic modeling
  - Language modeling
  - Decoding
  - Post-processing

**Audio Capture**

- Converts **analog sound waves to digital signals** using a microphone.
- Typical sampling rate for speech:

  - **16,000 samples per second (16 kHz)**
- Sampling rate considerations:

  - Higher rates (e.g., **44.1 kHz**) capture more detail but increase processing cost.
  - Speech systems balance clarity and efficiency at **8–16 kHz**.
- Accuracy is affected by:

  - Background noise
  - Microphone quality
  - Distance from the speaker
- Basic filters may remove hums, clicks, and background noise before further processing.

**Pre-Processing**

- Transforms raw audio into compact, meaningful representations.
- Discards irrelevant details such as absolute volume.

**Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs)**

- **Most common feature extraction technique** in speech recognition.
- Mimics human hearing by emphasizing speech-relevant frequencies.
- **MFCC process**:

  1. Divide audio into overlapping **20–30 ms frames**
  2. Apply **Fourier transform** to convert time domain to frequency domain
  3. Map frequencies to the **Mel scale**
  4. Extract a small set of coefficients (commonly **13 coefficients**)
- Output is a **sequence of feature vectors**, one per frame.
- Each vector contains **13 MFCC values** representing spectral shape.

**Acoustic Modeling**

- Learns the relationship between audio features and **phonemes**.
- **Phonemes** are the smallest sound units distinguishing words.

  - English uses approximately **44 phonemes**
  - Example: *cat* → /k/, /æ/, /t/
- Modern systems use **transformer architectures**.
- Transformer characteristics:

  - **Attention mechanisms** use surrounding frames for context
  - **Parallel processing** improves speed and accuracy
  - **Contextualized predictions** learn common phoneme sequences
- Output is a **probability distribution over phonemes** for each frame.
- Phonemes are **language-specific** and require retraining for other languages.

**Language Modeling**

- Resolves ambiguity where phonemes alone are insufficient.
- Applies knowledge of:

  - Vocabulary
  - Grammar
  - Common word patterns
- Language model guidance includes:

  - **Statistical patterns** from training data
  - **Context awareness** based on prior words
  - **Domain adaptation** for specialized terminology

**Decoding**

- Searches for the word sequence that best matches acoustic and language models.
- Balances:

  - Fidelity to the audio signal
  - Readability and grammatical correctness
- **Beam search decoding**:

  - Maintains a shortlist of top-scoring hypotheses
  - Extends, scores, and prunes candidates at each step
- Evaluates **thousands of hypotheses** for short utterances.
- Decoding is **computationally intensive**.

  - Real-time systems limit beam width and hypothesis depth to reduce latency.

**Post-Processing**

- Refines raw decoded text for presentation.
- Common tasks:

  - **Capitalization**
  - **Punctuation restoration**
  - **Number formatting**
  - **Profanity filtering**
  - **Inverse text normalization**
  - **Confidence scoring**
- Azure Speech returns:

  - Final transcription
  - **Word-level timestamps**
  - **Confidence scores**

**End-to-End Pipeline Flow**

- Audio capture → raw signal
- Pre-processing → MFCC features
- Acoustic modeling → phoneme probabilities
- Language modeling → vocabulary and grammar context
- Decoding → best word sequence
- Post-processing → readable, formatted text

**Key Facts to Remember**

- **Six stages** make up the speech recognition pipeline
- Typical speech sampling rate: **16 kHz**
- MFCCs commonly extract **13 coefficients**
- Audio frames are **20–30 ms**
- English has approximately **44 phonemes**
- Transformers are used for modern acoustic modeling
- Beam search is the most common decoding technique
- Post-processing improves readability and usability
