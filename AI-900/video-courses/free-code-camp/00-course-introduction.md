## Introduction to AI-900

**Timestamp**: 00:00:00 – 00:08:18

**Key Concepts**  

- AI-900 is the Azure AI Fundamentals certification exam.  
- Designed for those pursuing roles like AI Engineer or Data Scientist.  
- Covers understanding and defining Azure AI services: Cognitive Services, Azure Applied AI Services.  
- Includes AI concepts, knowledge mining, responsible AI, basics of ML pipelines, classical ML models, AutoML, generative AI workloads, and Azure AI Studio.  
- AI-900 is considered an entry-level, foundational exam, often a stepping stone to Azure AI Engineer or Data Scientist certifications.  
- Suggested learning paths:  
  - Ideally take AZ-900 (Azure Fundamentals) first for foundational Azure knowledge.  
  - DP-900 (Azure Data Fundamentals) is optional but commonly paired with AI-900 for data foundation.  
- AI-900 exam domains include AI workloads, machine learning principles, computer vision, natural language processing, and generative AI workloads.  
- Exam is descriptive in nature, focusing on understanding rather than deep technical implementation.  

**Definitions**  

- **AI-900**: The Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals certification exam code.  
- **Cognitive Services**: Pre-built AI services in Azure for vision, speech, language, and decision-making.  
- **Azure Applied AI Services**: Azure services that apply AI capabilities to solve business problems.  
- **Responsible AI**: Ethical and responsible use of AI technologies.  
- **AutoML**: Automated Machine Learning to simplify model creation.  
- **Generative AI Workloads**: AI tasks that generate new content, recently added to the AI-900 syllabus.  
- **Proctored Exam**: An exam monitored by a supervisor either in-person or online to ensure exam integrity.  
- **Seat Time**: Total time allocated for the exam session including instructions, NDA, exam, and feedback.  

**Key Facts**  

- AI-900 exam duration: 60 minutes actual exam time; 90 minutes seat time total.  
- Passing score: Approximately 700 out of 1000 (around 70%), but scaled scoring means 70% does not guarantee a pass.  
- Number of questions: 37 to 47 questions.  
- Question types: Multiple choice, multiple answer, drag and drop, hot area. No case studies.  
- No penalty for wrong answers.  
- Study time recommendations:  
  - Beginners (new to AI/ML and Azure): 15-30 hours.  
  - Intermediate (have AZ-900 or DP-900): 8-10 hours.  
  - Experienced (1+ year Azure or other cloud experience): ~5 hours or less.  
- Recommended study schedule: 30 minutes to 1 hour daily for 14 days.  
- Exam domains and their weightings:  
  - Describe AI workloads and considerations: 15-20%  
  - Describe fundamental principles of machine learning on Azure: 20-25%  
  - Describe features of computer vision workloads on Azure: 15-20%  
  - Describe features of natural language processing workloads on Azure: 15-20%  
  - Describe features of generative AI workloads on Azure: 15-20%  
- Certification validity: Does not expire as long as technology remains relevant.  
- Exam can be taken online (proctored) or in-person at test centers (Certiport, Pearson VUE, or local centers).  
- Practice exams strongly recommended; Azure exams are harder than some other cloud providers’ foundational exams.  

**Examples**  

- None specifically mentioned in this section.  

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  

- AI-900 is a foundational exam, good for beginners and those new to AI/ML on Azure.  
- Prior knowledge of Azure fundamentals (AZ-900) is highly recommended but not mandatory.  
- Combining AI-900 with DP-900 is a common and effective learning path.  
- Focus on understanding and describing AI concepts rather than deep technical skills.  
- Use a balanced study approach: watch lectures, do labs (if possible), and take practice exams.  
- Be mindful of potential small costs when running Azure AI Studio or ML instances during labs.  
- Practice exams are important to simulate real exam conditions and improve passing chances.  
- The exam is relatively short (60 minutes) with a moderate number of questions; time management is key.  
- Certification does not expire, so it’s a good long-term credential.  
- Choose exam delivery method (online vs in-person) based on personal preference and environment control.

## Exam Guide Breakdown

**Timestamp**: 00:08:18 – 00:12:51

**Key Concepts**  

- Overview of the official AI-900 exam outline and where to find it on Microsoft’s website  
- Frequent minor updates to Azure courses that do not significantly affect exam content  
- Major revisions lead to new exam codes (e.g., AI-100 → AI-102)  
- AI workloads and considerations: content moderation, personalization, computer vision, natural language processing, knowledge mining, document intelligence, generative AI  
- Responsible AI principles: Microsoft’s six key principles embedded across AI services  
- Fundamental machine learning principles on Azure: regression, classification, clustering, deep learning  
- Core ML concepts: features and labels, training and validation datasets  
- Automated machine learning (AutoML) capabilities and Azure ML services for model management and deployment  
- Computer Vision workloads and related Azure services (Image Classification, Object Detection, OCR, Facial Detection/Analysis, Video Indexer)  
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) workloads and Azure AI services (Language Service, Speech Service, Translator Service)  
- Generative AI workloads: features, scenarios, responsible AI considerations, Azure OpenAI Service capabilities (natural language, code, image generation)

**Definitions**
