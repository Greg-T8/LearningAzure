- **Image Classification**: Categorizing an image or video into a predefined class or category.  
- **Object Detection**: Identifying and labeling objects within an image or video along with their location boundaries.  
- **Semantic Segmentation**: Drawing pixel-level masks around objects or segments in an image, useful for detecting objects and movement.  
- **Image Analysis**: Applying descriptive context labels to images or videos (e.g., identifying an employee sitting at a desk in Tokyo).

  - **Computer Vision**: Analyze images/videos, extract descriptions, tags, objects, and text.  
  - **Custom Vision**: Build custom image classification and object detection models using your own images.  
  - **Face**: Detect and identify people and emotions in images.  
  - **Form Recognizer**: Scan documents and convert them into editable key-value or tabular data.  

**Examples**  
- Seeing AI app: Uses device camera to identify people and objects and audibly describe them for visually impaired users (iOS only).  
- Image analysis example: Describing a scene such as “an employee sitting at a desk in Tokyo.”  

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Understand the main types of computer vision tasks and their purposes (classification, detection, segmentation, OCR, facial detection).  
- Remember CNNs are the primary deep learning model for image/video recognition; RNNs are more for sequential data like handwriting and speech.  
- Be familiar with Azure’s computer vision services and their specific capabilities (Computer Vision, Custom Vision, Face, Form Recognizer).  
- Seeing AI is a practical Microsoft app example demonstrating computer vision’s accessibility use case.  
- OCR is important for converting image-based text into editable digital formats—commonly tested in exams.  
- Semantic segmentation involves pixel-level object identification, which is more detailed than object detection.
