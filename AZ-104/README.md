# AZ-104: Microsoft Azure Administrator — Hands-On Lab Series

**Objective:** Gain real-world, exam-aligned proficiency for the **AZ-104: Microsoft Azure Administrator** certification through a sequence of medium-to-hard, scenario-driven labs.

---

## 🎯 Overview

This repository provides a **structured, hands-on learning path** mapped directly to Microsoft’s official **AZ-104** objectives.

Each lab:
- Maps to an **official exam subskill**
- Integrates multiple **deployment modalities** (Portal, CLI, PowerShell, Bicep, Terraform)
- Intentionally requires referencing **Microsoft documentation**
- Reinforces **governance, automation, and troubleshooting**

Average lab duration: **1.5–2 hours**

## 📘 Exam Domains

| Domain | Weight |
|--------|--------|
| 1. Manage Azure identities and governance | 20–25% |
| 2. Implement and manage storage | 15–20% |
| 3. Deploy and manage Azure compute resources | 20–25% |
| 4. Implement and manage virtual networking | 15–20% |
| 5. Monitor and maintain Azure resources | 10–15% |

## 🧭 Learning Approach

- **Hands-on:** Every lab deploys and validates live Azure resources.  
- **Multi-modal:** Work through each scenario using Portal, CLI, PowerShell, and IaC (Bicep/Terraform).  
- **Exam-driven:** Fully aligned to the “Skills Measured” outline.  
- **Documentation-first:** Some parameters are intentionally omitted to encourage doc lookup.  
- **Scenario-based:** Assume the role of an Azure administrator responding to operational challenges.
