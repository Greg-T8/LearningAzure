# AZ-104: Microsoft Azure Administrator ‚Äî Hands-On Lab Series

**Objective:** Build real-world, exam-aligned proficiency for the **AZ-104: Microsoft Azure Administrator** certification through a sequence of medium-to-hard, scenario-driven labs.

---

## üéØ Overview

This repository contains a structured, hands-on path for mastering the **AZ-104** certification objectives.

Each lab is designed to:

- map directly to an **official exam subskill**,
- integrate multiple **deployment modalities** (Portal, CLI, PowerShell, Bicep, Terraform),
- force you to reference the **Microsoft documentation**,
- and reinforce troubleshooting, governance, and automation skills.

Average lab duration: **1.5‚Äì2 hours**

## üß≠ Learning Approach

- **Hands-on:** Every lab deploys and validates live Azure resources.  
- **Multi-modal:** Each scenario is implemented using Azure Portal, CLI, PowerShell, and Infrastructure as Code (Bicep or Terraform).  
- **Exam-driven:** Aligned with the **skills measured** outline; every bullet is covered.  
- **Documentation-first:** Labs intentionally omit some parameter details to force interaction with Microsoft Docs.  
- **Scenario-based:** You‚Äôll act as a cloud admin responding to realistic business or operational challenges.
