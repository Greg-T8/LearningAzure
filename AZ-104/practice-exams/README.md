## Practice Exam Strategy

📝 For each practice exam, I **document questions** ([example](./MU%20AZ-104%20Assessment/notes.md#configure-azcopy-authentication-for-blob-and-file-storage)) I answer incorrectly or feel uncertain about. I research the correct answers and **provide detailed explanations** within expandable tags for easy reference.

🛠️ For challenging questions, I go beyond theoretical study by building **hands-on labs** ([example](../hands-on-labs/storage/lab-azcopy-auth-methods/README.md)) using **Infrastructure as Code (Terraform or Bicep)**. These labs replicate the practice question scenarios in actual Azure environments, with links provided alongside each question.

✨ This approach transforms difficult exam scenarios into tangible, hands-on experience. It bridges the gap between certification study and real-world Azure administration skills.
