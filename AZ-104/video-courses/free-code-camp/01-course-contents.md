## Getting Started

**Timestamp**: 00:00:00 – 00:19:45

**Key Concepts**  
- Purpose of AZ-104 certification: validate Azure administrator skills for managing cloud workloads  
- AZ-104 is an associate-level certification focused on managing/configuring devices, users, permissions, compute, storage, and networking in Azure  
- Azure certification roadmap: Fundamentals (AZ-900) → Associate (e.g., AZ-104) → Expert (e.g., AZ-303) → Specialty certifications  
- AZ-104 is ideal for those seeking configuration-based roles rather than development roles  
- Azure exams emphasize practical, hands-on knowledge more than AWS or GCP exams  
- Exam delivery options: in-person or online proctored (PSI or Pearson VUE)  
- Exam format includes multiple question types: multiple choice, multiple answer, drag and drop, hot areas, and case studies  
- Passing score is 700/1000 (70%), but aiming for 75%+ on practice exams is recommended  
- Exam duration is 180 minutes, but allocate 210 minutes total for instructions and review  
- Certification validity is 24 months with possible free recertification options  
- Official exam skills outline is updated frequently; candidates should check Microsoft’s site for changes  
- Core exam domains:  
  - Manage Azure identities and governance  
  - Implement and manage storage  
  - Deploy and manage Azure compute resources  
  - Configure and manage virtual networks  
  - Monitor and backup Azure resources  

**Definitions**  
- **AZ-104**: Microsoft Azure Administrator Associate certification exam code  
- **Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)**: Cloud-based identity and access management service for user sign-ins and resource access  
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Method to assign permissions to users/groups at different scopes in Azure  
- **Azure Resource Manager (ARM)**: Deployment and management service for Azure resources using templates  
- **Proctored Exam**: An exam supervised by a person (in-person or online) to ensure exam integrity  
- **Case Study Questions**: Exam questions based on a business scenario requiring multiple related answers  

**Key Facts**  
- AZ-104 is generally taken after AZ-900 and before expert-level certifications like AZ-303  
- Study time recommendations:  
  - 2-3 years Azure experience → ~12 hours study  
  - 1 year experience → ~30 hours study  
  - No experience but passed AZ-900 → ~60 hours study (3 weeks at 1-3 hours/day)  
- Exam question count: 40 to 60 questions  
- No penalty for wrong answers; never leave questions blank  
- Some questions cannot be skipped and must be answered in order  
- Exam scoring is scaled; some questions worth more than one point  
- Microsoft Learn provides free content but is generally insufficient alone to pass AZ-104  
- Paid practice exams and layered study materials increase chances of passing  
- Certification lasts 24 months before recertification is required  

**Examples**  
- Example exam question type: Steps to set up Azure File Share Sync in correct order  
- Use of Azure AD for single sign-on to multiple resources like Microsoft 365, Azure Portal, SaaS apps, and internal apps  
- Exam pro platform uses Azure AD for admin panel login  

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Start your Azure certification journey with AZ-900 before AZ-104  
- AZ-104 focuses on practical skills managing core Azure services: identities, storage, compute, networking, and monitoring  
- Hands-on labs and follow-alongs in your own Azure account are critical for success  
- Aim for 85% on practice exams to build a buffer for the real exam’s 70% passing score  
- Prefer in-person exam delivery if possible to avoid technical issues common in online proctored exams  
- Regularly check Microsoft’s official exam guide for updates and changes to exam content  
- Understand the variety of question types and be prepared for case studies and scenario-based questions  
- Use multiple study resources including free videos, Microsoft Learn, and paid practice exams for best results  
- Manage your exam time wisely, allowing extra time for instructions and review  
- Certification renewal is required every 2 years, with potential free recertification options available
