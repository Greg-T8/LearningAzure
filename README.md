## 📖 Learning Approach

My exam preparation follows a structured approach designed to reinforce concepts through the following learning modalities:

1. **Microsoft Learning Paths** — Establish a solid foundation of core knowledge
2. **Video courses** — Visual reinforcement and deeper exploration of complex topics
3. **Practice Exams** — Assess readiness and identify knowledge gaps before taking the certification exam
4. **Hands-on Labs** — Practical experience using Terraform or Bicep, generated from practice exam questions
