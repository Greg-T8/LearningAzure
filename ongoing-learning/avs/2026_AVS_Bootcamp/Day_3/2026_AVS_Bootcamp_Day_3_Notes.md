- VMs inside AVS receive private IP addresses for Azure Storage Account via private DNS resolution.
- External VMs receive public IP addresses for Azure Storage Account.
- The DNS resolution process involves multiple components: application VM, DNS VM, DNS private resolver inbound endpoint, and Azure-provided DNS.
- Conditional forwarding and private DNS zones are key to resolving private IP addresses within linked virtual networks.

### Details

- **Secure, Private Connectivity to Azure Services**:  
  The slide highlights how Azure Private Endpoints combined with Private DNS Zones provide a mechanism for VMs to connect securely and privately to Azure services like Azure Storage Accounts.

- **From VM running in AVS (Azure VMware Solution)**:  
  When a VM inside AVS attempts to connect to an Azure Storage Account, the DNS query returns a **private IP address**. This is because the VM’s DNS resolution path is configured to use private DNS zones linked to the virtual network, enabling private endpoint resolution.

- **From External VM (outside AVS)**:  
  A VM outside the AVS environment querying the same Azure Storage Account will receive a **public IP address**. This is because it does not have access to the private DNS zones or private endpoint configurations linked to the AVS virtual network.

- **DNS Query Flow Explained by Speaker**:  
  - The application VM initiates a DNS query to connect to an Azure service (example given: SQL Managed Instance).  
  - The query is sent to a **DNS VM** configured with conditional forwarding rules.  
  - The DNS VM forwards the query to a **DNS private resolver inbound endpoint**.  
  - The DNS private resolver checks with the Azure-provided DNS service and recognizes the query originates from a virtual network linked to a private DNS zone.  
  - Because of this linkage, the resolver returns the **private IP address** associated with the Azure service (e.g., SQL Managed Instance).  
  - The response flows back from the Azure DNS to the DNS private resolver, then to the DNS VM, and finally to the application VM.  
  - This flow ensures that VMs inside AVS resolve Azure services to private IPs, maintaining secure and private connectivity.

- **Conditional Forwarding and Private DNS Zones**:  
  These configurations are essential to direct DNS queries appropriately and enable private IP resolution for Azure services within linked virtual networks.

- **Conditional Forwarder**: A DNS server configuration that forwards DNS queries for specific domains to designated DNS servers, used here to route queries to the DNS private resolver.

### Examples

- The speaker’s example focused on a VM inside AVS querying a SQL Managed Instance:  
  The DNS query flows through the DNS VM and DNS private resolver, which returns the private IP address of the SQL Managed Instance because the virtual network is linked to a private DNS zone.

- Contrast with an external VM querying the same Azure Storage Account, which receives a public IP address due to lack of private DNS zone linkage.

### Key Takeaways 🎯

- Azure Private Endpoints combined with Private DNS Zones enable VMs inside AVS to resolve Azure services to private IP addresses, ensuring secure and private connectivity.  
- DNS query flow involves conditional forwarding and private DNS resolvers to return private IPs for linked virtual networks.  
- VMs outside AVS or without private DNS zone linkage will resolve Azure services to public IP addresses.

---

### Details

**Slide Content: Azure Elastic SAN and AVS Configuration for Performance**

- **Co-location**: AVS private cloud and ESAN must be deployed in the same Azure region and zone to minimize latency and maximize performance.
  
- **iSCSI Sessions**:  
  - AV36, AV36P, AV52 SKUs require at least 6 iSCSI sessions distributed over 3 private endpoints.  
  - AV64 SKU requires 7 iSCSI sessions over 7 private endpoints.  
  This ensures sufficient parallelism and bandwidth for storage traffic.

- **Private Endpoint Configuration**:  
  Before mounting ESAN volumes as external datastores in AVS, configure the desired private endpoint to ensure proper network routing.

- **ESAN Volume Performance**:  
  A single ESAN volume backed by at least 16 base units can support up to 80,000 IOPS and/or 1280 MBps throughput.

- **AVS Disk Provisioning**:  
  Thick provisioning is recommended for virtual disks to avoid performance penalties associated with thin provisioning, which zeroes new blocks on demand causing initial write latency.

- **Network Bandwidth**:  
  - AV36 hosts support up to 10 Gbps iSCSI traffic; AV64 supports higher bandwidth.  
  - ExpressRoute Ultra Performance virtual network gateway supports 10 Gbps bandwidth.  
  - ExpressRoute Scale Gateway can scale up to 20 Gbps with 10 scale units, but this is not guaranteed due to Quality of Service (QoS) constraints.  
  - Currently, a Software-Defined Data Center (SDDC) supports a max of 10 Gbps iSCSI traffic, with plans to relax this limit.

---

**Speaker Narration: HCX Migration Best Practices and Scaling**

- **HCX Overview**:  
  Hybrid Cloud Extension (HCX) is a Broadcom hypervisor suite tool used extensively for migrating workloads between vSphere environments without IP changes, supporting live migrations, bulk moves, and network extensions.

- **HCX Complexity**:  
  The HCX user guide is extensive, covering installation, site pairing, and interconnects. Misconfigurations are common and can cause migration issues.

- **Scaling HCX Appliances**:  
  - When increasing migration parallelism, scale HCX appliances to avoid control plane or data plane contention.  
  - Heavy use of Layer 2 network extensions (e.g., 10-20 VLANs per appliance) can saturate appliances.  
  - Network extension appliances have a limit of 8 per deployment; concentration of networks on few appliances risks performance degradation.

- **Indicators to Scale**:  
  - Rapid increase in newly stretched networks.  
  - Migration performance degradation, such as initial syncs taking hours instead of minutes, indicating CPU or memory saturation on HCX appliances.

- **Service Mesh Scaling**:  
  - Start with a single HCX service mesh for pilot migrations.  
  - Scale out by adding multiple service meshes when concurrency increases or isolation is needed (e.g., different clusters, network profiles).  
  - Maximum supported service meshes per HCX manager is 64, but Microsoft recommends fewer for operational simplicity.  
  - HCX does not auto-load balance migrations across meshes; load distribution is a manual operational task.

- **Network Extension Gateway Management**:  
  - After L2 stretch cutover, promptly move the gateway to the cloud to avoid inefficient routing paths (tromboning/hairpinning).

- **Mobility Optimized Networks (MON)**:  
  - Use MON only when necessary, as it has limitations including lack of support for third-party gateways, topology constraints, and risk of asymmetric routing if the gateway is not moved promptly.  
  - MON is an advanced feature designed to optimize east-west traffic and reduce tromboning during network stretches.

---

### Definitions

- **Azure VMware Solution (AVS)**: A Microsoft Azure service that enables running VMware workloads natively on Azure infrastructure.

- **Elastic SAN (ESAN)**: Azure’s scalable, high-performance software-defined storage solution designed to provide block storage for AVS.

- **iSCSI Sessions**: Network sessions using the Internet Small Computer Systems Interface protocol to connect storage devices over IP networks.

- **Thick Provisioning**: Allocating the full amount of storage space upfront for a virtual disk, improving performance by avoiding on-demand zeroing of blocks.

- **Hybrid Cloud Extension (HCX)**: A Broadcom tool integrated with AVS that facilitates workload migration and network extension between on-premises and cloud vSphere environments.

- **Service Mesh (HCX)**: Logical grouping of HCX appliances that manage migration and network extension traffic; scaling out service meshes improves concurrency and isolation.

- **Mobility Optimized Networks (MON)**: An advanced HCX feature to optimize network traffic paths during L2 network extensions, reducing tromboning and hairpinning.

- **Tromboning/Hairpinning**: Inefficient network routing where traffic takes a longer path than necessary, often back through the source location.

---

### Examples

- **iSCSI Session Configuration**:  
  For an AV36 SKU host, configure 6 iSCSI sessions distributed over 3 private endpoints to ensure sufficient parallel storage access.

- **HCX Appliance Saturation**:  
  If initial VM syncs during migration start taking hours instead of minutes, this indicates HCX appliances are CPU or memory bound and need scaling.

- **Service Mesh Load Distribution**:  
  When migrating large production waves, deploy multiple HCX service meshes and assign migration waves by cluster or workload group to balance load manually.

- **L2 Network Stretch Gateway Move**:  
  After completing a Layer 2 network extension migration, immediately move the gateway in the portal to avoid traffic routing inefficiencies.

---

### Key Takeaways 🎯

- Co-locate AVS and ESAN in the same region and zone; configure iSCSI sessions and private endpoints per SKU guidelines to meet performance targets.

- Use thick provisioning for AVS virtual disks to avoid initial write performance penalties.

- ESAN volumes with at least 16 base units can deliver up to 80K IOPS and 1280 MBps throughput.

- Network bandwidth per AVS host and ExpressRoute gateway has limits; scaling options exist but may be constrained by QoS.

- HCX is essential for migrations but requires careful scaling of appliances and service meshes as migration concurrency increases.

- Monitor for signs of HCX saturation (e.g., slow syncs, stretched networks) and scale accordingly.

- Distribute migration load manually across multiple HCX service meshes to avoid bottlenecks.

- After L2 network stretch, promptly move the gateway to the cloud to prevent inefficient routing.

- Use Mobility Optimized Networks only when necessary due to their complexity and limitations.

These best practices ensure smooth, high-performance migrations and operations within Azure VMware Solution environments.

## Slide 86: Large Customer Migration – HCX Lessons learned

**Timestamp**: 02:11:10 – 02:11:46

![Slide 86](2026_AVS_Bootcamp_Day_3_Notes_images/slide_086.png)

### Key Points

- For large-scale customer migrations using HCX, it is critical to scale infrastructure components appropriately.
- NSX and HCX appliances should be scaled to Extra Large size to handle large migration workloads.
- The management cluster must be scaled to support the increased management load during migration.
- Deploying multiple Service Meshes enables parallel migration processes, improving efficiency.
- Migration load should be evenly distributed across Service Meshes to avoid bottlenecks.
- When using Layer 2 (L2) stretch networks, the gateway should be moved and removed promptly after cutover to minimize risks.
- Use MON (Monitor mode) only when necessary to avoid unnecessary overhead.
- Customers new to Azure or Azure VMware Solution (AVS) may leverage different platform generations (Gen 1 or Gen 2) depending on their environment and requirements.

### Details

- **Scaling NSX and HCX Appliances**: For large migrations, the standard appliance sizes may not suffice. Scaling to Extra Large appliances ensures sufficient resources (CPU, memory, network throughput) to handle the volume and complexity of data migration without performance degradation.

- **Management Cluster Scaling**: The management cluster, which orchestrates and controls migration activities, must be scaled up to handle the increased load from managing multiple migrations and large data volumes. This prevents management bottlenecks and ensures smooth operation.

- **Multiple Service Meshes Deployment**: Service Meshes are logical groupings that manage migration traffic and services. Deploying multiple Service Meshes allows migrations to run in parallel, significantly reducing total migration time.

- **Load Distribution**: Even distribution of migration load across Service Meshes is essential to avoid overloading any single mesh, which could cause delays or failures.

- **L2 Stretch Gateway Handling**: Layer 2 stretch networks allow VMs to maintain the same IP addresses across source and target sites during migration. However, the gateway that supports this stretch should be moved and removed quickly after cutover to avoid network conflicts and ensure clean network segmentation.

- **Use of MON (Monitor Mode)**: MON mode is a feature that can be enabled for monitoring migration traffic or troubleshooting. It should be used sparingly and only when necessary to avoid additional overhead or complexity.

- **Context from Speaker**: The speaker highlighted that customers new to Azure or AVS might be using different platform generations (Gen 1 or Gen 2). This distinction is important because it affects how migrations are planned and executed. Customers with existing Azure footprints but new to AVS need to understand these platform differences to optimize their migration strategy.

### Definitions

- **HCX (Hybrid Cloud Extension)**: A VMware technology that facilitates workload migration, disaster recovery, and network extension between on-premises data centers and cloud environments.

- **NSX**: VMware’s network virtualization and security platform that provides networking and security services in virtualized environments.

- **Service Mesh**: A dedicated infrastructure layer that manages service-to-service communication, in this context used to manage migration traffic and services.

- **L2 Stretch**: A network configuration that extends Layer 2 networks across geographically dispersed sites, allowing VMs to retain their IP addresses during migration.

- **MON (Monitor Mode)**: A mode used to monitor migration traffic or diagnose issues during migration processes.

- **Gen 1 and Gen 2 Platforms**: Different generations of Azure VMware Solution platforms, each with distinct features and capabilities relevant to migration planning.

### Examples

- No specific concrete examples or demonstrations were provided in the transcript or slide content.

### Key Takeaways 🎯

- Proper scaling of NSX, HCX appliances, and management clusters is essential for successful large-scale migrations.
- Deploy multiple Service Meshes and distribute migration load evenly to maximize parallelism and efficiency.
- Handle L2 stretch gateways carefully by moving and removing them quickly after cutover to maintain network integrity.
- Use MON mode only when necessary to avoid unnecessary overhead.
- Understand the differences between Gen 1 and Gen 2 Azure VMware Solution platforms when planning migrations, especially for customers new to AVS or Azure.

  - Suitable for newer architectures where vSphere hosts are directly attached to Azure VNets.
  - Provides longer operational runway and easier hardware availability.
  - Enables hybrid setups where Gen 2 environments can connect to Azure VWAN hubs and peer with other Azure VNets, facilitating communication across environments.

- **Hybrid Deployment Scenario**:
  - A customer may run Gen 1 in one environment (e.g., a private cloud connected via ExpressRoute).
  - The same customer can deploy Gen 2 in another environment (e.g., a branch or secondary data center).
  - Gen 2 environments connect quickly to Azure VWAN hubs, enabling seamless connectivity back to Gen 1 environments and other Azure VNets.
  - This hybrid approach leverages the strengths of both generations, providing operational flexibility and integration options.

### Definitions

- **Gen 1**: The original flavor of the product that uses Microsoft-managed ExpressRoute circuits for connectivity, supports large numbers of networks, and has broad regional availability and SKU flexibility.

- **Gen 2**: The newer architecture that integrates directly with Azure VNets using Microsoft Fleet hardware, enabling easier and faster integration with Azure services through VNet peering and VWAN hubs.

- **ExpressRoute Circuit**: A Microsoft-managed private connection that Gen 1 uses to connect the private cloud environment to customer-managed hubs or managed V1 hubs.

- **VNet Peering**: A method to connect Azure Virtual Networks (VNets) directly, allowing resources in different VNets to communicate with low latency and high bandwidth.

- **VWAN Hub**: Azure Virtual WAN hub, a central networking construct that facilitates connectivity between VNets, on-premises networks, and other environments.

- **NSX-T Constructs**: VMware NSX-T networking components such as distributed firewalls and network segments used for micro-segmentation and network virtualization.

### Examples

- A telco or hosting provider with thousands of VLANs and complex NSX-T setups chooses Gen 1 due to its ability to handle large network scales and licensing economics (e.g., Oracle licensing).

- A customer runs a Gen 1 ABS private cloud connected via an ExpressRoute circuit with a dedicated Microsoft Edge router.

- The same customer deploys Gen 2 in a secondary data center or branch, connecting it directly to an Azure VWAN hub within minutes, enabling hybrid connectivity between Gen 1 and Gen 2 environments.

### Key Takeaways 🎯

- The choice between Gen 1 and Gen 2 is driven by customer environment scale, licensing, operational runway, and integration priorities.
- Gen 1 excels in large, complex network environments requiring ExpressRoute connectivity and broad regional availability.
- Gen 2 offers modern Azure integration with direct VNet connectivity and faster deployment.
- Both generations can coexist, enabling hybrid cloud architectures that leverage the strengths of each.
- Understanding the connectivity models (ExpressRoute vs. VNet peering) is critical to designing the right solution.

## Slide 89: Gen 2 Landing Zone Readiness

**Timestamp**: 02:18:28 – 02:20:07

![Slide 89](2026_AVS_Bootcamp_Day_3_Notes_images/slide_089.png)

### Key Points

- Gen 2 Landing Zone readiness requires careful IP address planning before deployment.
- Customers should request a /21 IP address block to accommodate all necessary subnets.
- A minimum /22 is required for the Azure VMware Solution (AVS) private cloud management plane.
- HCX integration in Gen 2 requires at least two additional /24 subnets (one for management, one for uplink).
- Additional IP space is needed for future expansion such as Site Recovery Manager (SRM), additional network meshes, and Network Virtual Appliances (NVAs).
- Planning IP space early avoids deployment delays and network conflicts.

### Details

- **Gen 2 Landing Zone**: Refers to the network environment setup for Azure VMware Solution (AVS) Gen 2 deployments.
- **IP Address Blocks**:
  - The AVS private cloud management plane requires a minimum of a /22 subnet.
  - HCX (Hybrid Cloud Extension) requires at least two separate /24 subnets: one for management and one for uplink.
  - Because of these combined requirements, customers should request a /21 subnet block to cover all needs comfortably.
- **Microsoft-managed delegated subnets**: In Gen 2, some subnets are delegated and managed by Microsoft within the customer's provided IP range.
- **Why /21?**:
  - A /21 subnet provides enough IP addresses to carve out:
    - The /22 subnet for AVS management.
    - Multiple /24 subnets for HCX components.
    - Additional subnets for future expansion such as SRM, additional network meshes, and NVAs.
- **Planning IP space**:
  - It is critical to plan and allocate IP address space *before* deployment rather than during it.
  - This proactive planning prevents migration slowdowns and network configuration issues.
- **Workload segments**:
  - The workload network segments should be carved out separately from the management and HCX subnets.
- **Gen 1 vs Gen 2**:
  - Both Gen 1 and Gen 2 require a /22 for the AVS management plane.
  - Gen 2 uniquely requires additional /24 subnets for HCX, which is why the larger /21 block is recommended.
- **Speaker emphasis**:
  - The speaker stresses that even if a /22 seems sufficient today, planning for a /21 is safer when deploying Gen 2 with HCX.
  - This ensures flexibility and room for future network components without needing to readdress or redesign the network.

### Definitions

- **Gen 2 Landing Zone**: The network and infrastructure environment setup for deploying Azure VMware Solution Gen 2, including IP subnet allocation and delegated subnets.
- **AVS (Azure VMware Solution)**: A Microsoft Azure service that allows customers to run VMware workloads natively on Azure.
- **HCX (Hybrid Cloud Extension)**: A VMware technology that enables workload migration and network extension between on-premises environments and cloud environments like AVS.
- **/21, /22, /24**: CIDR notation for IP subnet sizes. A /21 subnet contains 2048 IP addresses, /22 contains 1024, and /24 contains 256.
- **Management Plane**: The network segment used for managing the AVS private cloud infrastructure components.
- **Delegated Subnets**: Subnets within a customer's IP range that are managed by Microsoft for specific services.
- **NVA (Network Virtual Appliance)**: Virtual appliances such as firewalls or routers deployed within the virtual network.
- **SRM (Site Recovery Manager)**: A disaster recovery management tool that may require additional network resources.

### Examples

- If a customer requests only a /22 subnet for AVS Gen 2 with HCX, they will lack sufficient IP space for HCX uplink and management subnets, potentially causing deployment issues.
- By requesting a /21 subnet, the customer can allocate:
  - One /22 for AVS management.
  - Two /24 subnets for HCX (management and uplink).
  - Additional /24 subnets for future expansion like SRM or NVAs.
- The speaker illustrated that Microsoft-managed delegated subnets are carved from the /21 block provided by the customer, highlighting the importance of providing a sufficiently large IP block.

### Key Takeaways 🎯

- Always plan and request at least a /21 subnet block for Gen 2 AVS deployments that include HCX.
- The /21 block covers AVS management (/22), HCX subnets (two /24s), and future network expansions.
- Early IP space planning is critical to avoid migration delays and network reconfiguration.
- Gen 2 introduces new subnet requirements compared to Gen 1, especially due to HCX.
- Microsoft manages delegated subnets carved from the customer-provided IP range, so providing adequate IP space is essential.

## Slide 90: Gen2 DNS is not the same as Gen1

**Timestamp**: 02:20:07 – 02:22:27

![Slide 90](2026_AVS_Bootcamp_Day_3_Notes_images/slide_090.png)

### Key Points

- Gen2 DNS differs significantly from Gen1 DNS in Azure VMware Solution (AVS) environments.
- Gen2 uses Microsoft Managed Private DNS zones scoped specifically to the AVS VNet.
- Private DNS resolution for Gen2 workloads requires a DNS resolver deployed within the same VNet as AVS.
- Hub-only DNS resolvers or DNS solutions outside the AVS VNet are insufficient for Gen2 private name resolution.
- Proper DNS forwarding rules must be configured to enable name resolution from outside the AVS VNet.

### Details

- **Gen2 DNS vs Gen1 DNS**  
  Gen2 DNS introduces new constructs and behaviors that are not present in Gen1. Unlike Gen1, Gen2 uses Microsoft Managed Private DNS zones that are scoped exclusively to the AVS VNet. This means the private DNS zones (e.g., `*.abs.azure.com`) are linked only to the AVS VNet and cannot be linked to hub or spoke VNets.

- **Private DNS Zones and VNet Scope**  
  The private DNS zones in Gen2 are VNet-scoped, meaning only resources within the AVS VNet can directly resolve the AVS management plane FQDNs such as vCenter and NSX addresses.

- **Requirement for DNS Resolver in AVS VNet**  
  To enable DNS resolution of AVS FQDNs from outside the AVS VNet (e.g., from on-premises or other VNets), you must deploy either:  
  - An Azure Private DNS Resolver, or  
  - A DNS virtual machine (VM) acting as a resolver  
  within the same AVS VNet.

- **Why Hub-Only DNS Resolvers Are Insufficient**  
  Hub-only DNS resolvers or DNS forwarding solutions located outside the AVS VNet cannot resolve Gen2 private DNS names because the private DNS zones are not linked to those VNets. Attempts to forward DNS queries to hub-level resolvers will fail to resolve AVS management plane names.

- **DNS Forwarding Configuration**  
  To enable external workloads or on-premises systems to resolve AVS names, you must:  
  1. Deploy the private DNS resolver inside the AVS VNet.  
  2. Configure forwarding rules that direct queries for `abs.azure.com` to the inbound endpoint of the private DNS resolver.

- **Common Pitfalls**  
  Customers often try to forward DNS queries to hub-level resolvers or on-prem DNS servers without deploying a resolver in the AVS VNet, resulting in broken connectivity to AVS components like vCenter and NSX.

- **Summary**  
  Gen2 DNS is unique due to its VNet-scoped private DNS zones and requires a DNS resolver within the AVS VNet for private name resolution. This is a critical difference from Gen1, which did not have this VNet-scoped DNS behavior.

### Definitions

- **Gen2 DNS**: The DNS architecture used in Azure VMware Solution Gen2, featuring Microsoft Managed Private DNS zones scoped to the AVS VNet, requiring specialized DNS resolvers within that VNet for private name resolution.

- **Private DNS Resolver**: An Azure service or DNS VM deployed within the AVS VNet that forwards DNS queries for private zones to enable name resolution from outside the AVS VNet.

- **VNet Scope DNS Behavior**: A DNS zone configuration where the private DNS zone is linked only to a specific virtual network (VNet), restricting DNS resolution to resources within that VNet.

- **Hub-only DNS Resolver**: A DNS resolver deployed in a hub VNet intended to serve multiple spoke VNets, which is insufficient for Gen2 DNS private name resolution because the private DNS zones are not linked to the hub VNet.

### Examples

- Customers attempting to resolve vCenter or NSX FQDNs from on-premises or other VNets by forwarding DNS queries to a hub-level DNS resolver fail because the private DNS zones are not linked to the hub VNet.

- Successful resolution requires deploying a private DNS resolver inside the AVS VNet and configuring forwarding rules to the inbound endpoint of the resolver for the `abs.azure.com` domain.

### Key Takeaways 🎯

- Gen2 DNS uses Microsoft Managed Private DNS zones scoped exclusively to the AVS VNet, unlike Gen1.

- To resolve AVS private DNS names (e.g., vCenter, NSX) from outside the AVS VNet, a private DNS resolver must be deployed inside the AVS VNet.

- Hub-only DNS resolvers or DNS solutions outside the AVS VNet will not work for Gen2 private name resolution.

- Proper DNS forwarding rules to the private DNS resolver’s inbound endpoint are essential for external name resolution.

- Understanding and implementing Gen2 DNS correctly is critical to maintaining connectivity and management plane access in AVS Gen2 environments.

## Slide 91: Other Gen 2 Special Design Considerations

**Timestamp**: 02:27:05 – 02:32:02

![Slide 91](2026_AVS_Bootcamp_Day_3_Notes_images/slide_091.png)

### Key Points

- Gen 2 private clouds have specific route limitations and deployment requirements that differ from Gen 1.
- Gen 2 does not include a built-in SNAT option for outbound internet access; alternative methods must be planned.
- Proper role-based access control (RBAC) permissions are critical for successful deployment.
- The virtual network (VNet) and private cloud must reside in the same resource group.
- Only one Gen 2 SDDC (Software-Defined Data Center) is allowed per resource group.
- Cross-resource group or subscription references (e.g., DDoS protection, UDRs) can cause installation failures.
- Azure Policies enforcing UDR or NSG rules may interfere with installation.
- Enabling VNet automatic peering sync (currently in preview) helps dynamically update peerings.

### Details

- **Route Limitations**: Gen 2 private clouds have a maximum usable route size of /16. This means the IP address space for routing is limited, and careful planning is required to avoid exceeding this limit.

- **Outbound Internet Access (No SNAT in Gen 2)**:
  - Unlike Gen 1, which provided a simple SNAT checkbox option for outbound internet access, Gen 2 does not include this feature.
  - To enable internet egress for workloads in Gen 2 private clouds, you must plan to route outbound traffic through:
    - Azure Firewall
    - Network Virtual Appliances (NVAs), such as third-party firewalls or MBAs
    - Force tunneling back to on-premises networks
  - This is important for environments that require internet access for updates, testing, or other outbound connectivity.

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Requirements**:
  - The deployer account (the user or service principal running the deployment) must have either:
    - Owner role, or
    - User Access Administrator role
  - This permission must be granted at the deployment scope.
  - While documentation suggests subscription-level permissions, practical experience shows that owner permissions at the resource group level where deployment occurs are sufficient.
  - These permissions are necessary because the deployment process provisions special role assignments unique to Gen 2 private clouds.
  - Insufficient permissions will cause role assignment failures and partial installation failures.

- **Resource Group Constraints**:
  - The AVS virtual network and the Gen 2 private cloud must be created in the **same resource group**.
  - This is a current service limitation and differs from typical Azure resource management where networking and compute resources can be separated.
  - Customers often separate networking and compute into different resource groups, but this is not supported for Gen 2 AVS deployments.
  - Coordination between teams managing networking and infrastructure is required.

- **Single Gen 2 SDDC per Resource Group**:
  - Only one Gen 2 SDDC can exist in a single resource group.
  - If multiple private clouds are needed, they must be deployed in separate resource groups.
  - This is less common but relevant for large customers or complex environments.

- **Cross-Scope References and Policy Conflicts**:
  - Cross-resource group or cross-subscription references, such as DDoS protection plans, user-defined routes (UDRs), or other network linkages, can cause installation failures.
  - Policies that enforce UDR or NSG (Network Security Group) rules strictly may also block or interfere with the installation process.
  - If such policies or protections are in place, they should be temporarily disabled or unlinked from the AVS VNet during installation.
  - After successful deployment, these protections and policies can generally be re-enabled or relinked, though some edge cases may require additional troubleshooting.

- **VNet Automatic Peering Sync (Preview)**:
  - There is a preview feature to enable automatic synchronization of VNet peerings.
  - This helps dynamically update peerings as changes occur, reducing manual management overhead.

### Definitions

- **SNAT (Source Network Address Translation)**: A method that allows outbound internet traffic from private IP addresses by translating them to a public IP address. Gen 1 AVS provided a built-in SNAT option for outbound internet access, which Gen 2 lacks.

- **NVA (Network Virtual Appliance)**: A virtual appliance, often a third-party firewall or router, deployed in Azure to manage network traffic, including outbound internet egress.

- **Force Tunneling**: A network routing technique that forces all outbound internet traffic to be routed back through on-premises networks or specific network appliances for inspection or compliance.

- **UDR (User-Defined Route)**: Custom routing rules defined by users to control traffic flow within Azure VNets.

- **NSG (Network Security Group)**: Azure resource used to filter network traffic to and from Azure resources based on rules.

- **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**: Azure's system for managing user permissions and access to resources.

- **SDDC (Software-Defined Data Center)**: A virtualized data center environment, in this context referring to the AVS private cloud instance.

### Examples

- **Outbound Internet Access in Gen 1 vs Gen 2**:
  - Gen 1: A checkbox option enabled SNAT for outbound internet access, suitable for test or demo environments with minimal filtering needs.
  - Gen 2: No SNAT option; outbound internet must be routed via Azure Firewall, third-party NVAs, or force tunneling to on-premises.

- **RBAC Permissions Scenario**:
  - A deployment fails because the deployer account only has contributor permissions.
  - Granting owner or user access administrator role at the resource group level resolves the failure because the deployment needs to create special role assignments.

- **Resource Group Limitation Scenario**:
  - A customer tries to deploy the AVS VNet in one resource group and the private cloud in another.
  - Deployment fails due to the service limitation requiring both to be in the same resource group.

- **Policy Conflict Scenario**:
  - A customer has a DDoS protection plan applied at a subscription level that automatically links to all VNets.
  - Deployment fails due to this linkage.
  - Temporarily unlinking the DDoS protection from the AVS VNet allows deployment to succeed.
  - After deployment, the protection can be re-applied.

### Key Takeaways 🎯

- Gen 2 AVS private clouds have stricter deployment and configuration requirements than Gen 1, especially regarding outbound internet access and resource group organization.
- Plan outbound internet egress carefully since Gen 2 lacks a built-in SNAT option.
- Ensure the deployer account has sufficient RBAC permissions (owner or user access administrator) at the deployment scope.
- Keep the AVS virtual network and private cloud in the same resource group.
- Only one Gen 2 SDDC per resource group is allowed; use separate resource groups for multiple deployments.
- Temporarily disable or unlink cross-scope policies (DDoS, UDRs, NSGs) that may interfere with installation.
- Use VNet automatic peering sync (preview) to simplify peering management.

**Timestamp**: 02:32:02 – 02:32:38

![Slide 92](2026_AVS_Bootcamp_Day_3_Notes_images/slide_092.png)

### Key Points

- Observability in Azure VMware Solution (AVS) is critical beyond initial deployment, especially for ongoing monitoring (day two operations).
- There are seven core areas of observability in AVS that cover infrastructure and the broader ecosystem.
- Host metrics are foundational, focusing on physical hosts that support the private cloud.
- Monitoring host CPU consumption helps in capacity planning—scaling out or scaling down nodes based on workload demands.
- Observability should encompass not only hosts but also logs, alerts, VM guest monitoring, syslog exports, Azure services consumed by AVS, VMware control plane, and application monitoring.

### Details

- **Observability Landscape in AVS**: The slide lists seven key areas where monitoring and observability should be implemented to ensure comprehensive coverage of the AVS environment.
  
- **Seven Core Observability Areas**:
  1. **Host Metrics**: Physical hosts underpinning the private cloud are monitored for performance metrics such as CPU consumption. This is crucial because these hosts are dedicated to the AVS deployment and directly impact performance and capacity.
  2. **Activity Log Generated Alerts**: Alerts generated from activity logs help in identifying operational issues or changes within the environment.
  3. **VM Guest Monitoring**: Monitoring inside the virtual machines themselves to track performance and health at the guest OS level.
  4. **Syslog Export**: Exporting syslog data for centralized logging and analysis.
  5. **AVS Consumed Azure Services**: Observing Azure services that AVS utilizes to understand dependencies and performance impacts.
  6. **VMware Control Plane**: Monitoring the VMware management components that control the private cloud environment.
  7. **Application Monitoring**: Observing the applications running on AVS to ensure end-to-end performance and availability.

- **Speaker’s Emphasis on Host Metrics**:
  - Host metrics are the first and foundational observability area because physical hosts have direct performance implications.
  - CPU consumption is a key metric: high CPU usage may indicate the need to add more nodes to the private cloud to handle workload demands.
  - Conversely, if CPU consumption decreases, it may signal an opportunity to reduce nodes to optimize costs.
  - This dynamic scaling consideration is important because AVS runs in a cloud environment where resource optimization can lead to cost savings.

- **Context**:
  - The speaker highlights a common challenge: organizations often focus on deploying AVS but neglect comprehensive monitoring afterward.
  - Effective observability ensures not only infrastructure health but also the health of the entire ecosystem supported by AVS.
  - The slide and narration together provide a framework for what areas to monitor and why.

### Definitions

- **Host Metrics**: Performance data collected from the physical servers (hosts) that run the private cloud infrastructure, including CPU, memory, and other resource usage.
- **Activity Log Generated Alerts**: Notifications triggered by specific events or changes recorded in activity logs, used to detect operational issues.
- **VM Guest Monitoring**: Monitoring the performance and health of virtual machines from within the guest operating system.
- **Syslog Export**: The process of sending system log messages to a centralized logging system for analysis and troubleshooting.
- **AVS Consumed Azure Services**: Azure platform services that are utilized by AVS to deliver its functionality.
- **VMware Control Plane**: The management layer of VMware that controls the private cloud environment, including components like vCenter.
- **Application Monitoring**: Tracking the performance, availability, and health of applications running on the AVS infrastructure.

### Examples

- Monitoring CPU consumption on physical hosts to decide when to add or remove nodes:
  - If CPU usage is consistently high, add nodes to increase capacity.
  - If CPU usage drops after a workload peak, consider reducing nodes to save costs.

### Key Takeaways 🎯

- Observability in AVS must cover multiple layers: from physical hosts to applications.
- Host metrics are critical for capacity planning and cost optimization.
- Effective monitoring requires a holistic approach that includes logs, alerts, VM guest data, syslog, Azure services, VMware control plane, and applications.
- Organizations should prioritize enabling comprehensive observability early to avoid gaps in monitoring after deployment.

- Host-level metrics can be viewed at both individual host and cluster levels.

### Details

- **Host and VSAN Datastore Metrics**: AVS observability focuses on collecting and analyzing metrics related to the physical hosts and the VSAN datastore within the private cloud environment.
  
- **Purpose of Metrics**: These metrics are essential for monitoring resource usage at both the host and cluster levels. They provide insight into whether the infrastructure is under stress or underutilized, which informs decisions about scaling.

- **Scaling Clusters Based on Load**:
  - When CPU consumption or other metrics become high (e.g., CPU usage reaching warning or critical thresholds), it may indicate the need to add more nodes to the cluster to handle the workload.
  - Conversely, if CPU or memory usage drops significantly, it may be possible to reduce the number of nodes to optimize costs.
  
- **Sample Metrics and Thresholds**:
  - **CPU Usage**: Warning at 80%, Critical at 90%
  - **Memory Usage**: Warning at 80%, Critical at 90%
  - **VSAN Usage**: Warning at 70%, Critical at 75%
  
- **vSAN Metric Importance**:
  - vSAN consumption is a key metric tied directly to SLA compliance.
  - The SLA for ABS (Azure VMware Solution) includes maximum allowable vSAN consumption.
  - Crossing the 75% vSAN usage threshold means the private cloud is out of SLA compliance.
  - To maintain SLA compliance, administrators must either add nodes to increase vSAN capacity or clean up existing storage to reduce usage below 75%.
  
- **Host-Level Metrics**:
  - Metrics can be viewed at the individual host level or aggregated at the cluster level.
  - This granularity helps identify specific hosts that may be underperforming or overutilized.
  
- **Design Documentation**:
  - AVS Host Metrics Design Docs provide detailed guidance on monitoring and managing these metrics.
  
- **Operational Impact**:
  - Monitoring these metrics proactively helps avoid performance degradation.
  - It also supports cost optimization by scaling resources according to actual demand.

### Definitions

- **vSAN (Virtual SAN)**: A software-defined storage solution that aggregates local storage devices across hosts in a VMware cluster to create a shared datastore.
  
- **SLA (Service Level Agreement)**: A formal commitment that defines the expected performance and availability standards for a service, including resource usage limits.

### Examples

- If CPU consumption on a host reaches 80% (warning) or 90% (critical), this signals the need to add nodes to the cluster to handle increased workload.
- If CPU consumption drops after a peak workload, nodes can be removed to save costs.
- When vSAN usage approaches 70% (warning) or exceeds 75% (critical), administrators must act to add storage capacity or clean up data to remain within SLA limits.

### Key Takeaways 🎯

- Monitoring host and VSAN datastore metrics is crucial for maintaining performance and SLA compliance in AVS environments.
- Defined warning and critical thresholds for CPU, memory, and vSAN usage guide operational decisions.
- vSAN usage above 75% breaches SLA, requiring immediate remediation.
- Host-level metrics enable precise scaling and cost optimization of private cloud resources.

### Key Points

- AVS (Azure VMware Solution) can emit syslog data from VMware stack components such as vCenter and NSX.
- Syslog emission is configured via AVS diagnostic settings.
- Syslog data can be sent to multiple targets including Azure Log Analytics, storage accounts, and third-party solutions via Event Hub.
- The syslog stream is very dense and generates a large volume of data, which can lead to significant costs.
- It is recommended to enable syslog only when necessary.
- Third-party integrations and logic app instructions are available to help filter and manage syslog data.
- Filtering capabilities are currently limited but improvements are planned.

### Details

- **Syslog Emission from AVS**: AVS emits syslog data originating from Broadcom components within the VMware stack, specifically including vCenter and NSX components. This syslog stream provides detailed diagnostic logs useful for troubleshooting and monitoring.

- **Configuration**: Syslog output is configured through the standard AVS diagnostic settings interface. Users can select which logs and metrics to send, including all logs and all metrics if desired.

- **Targets for Syslog Data**:
  - Azure Log Analytics workspace (default recommended target)
  - Azure Storage accounts
  - Third-party solutions via Azure Event Hub
  - Third-party integrations can be managed using Azure Logic Apps, with provided instructions to facilitate this.

- **Volume and Cost Considerations**:
  - The syslog stream is described as "very dense," meaning it produces a high volume of log data.
  - Because of the volume, storing and analyzing these logs can incur substantial costs, especially when using Log Analytics.
  - Customers are cautioned to enable syslog only when necessary to avoid unexpected charges.

- **Filtering and Management**:
  - Currently, syslog data is minimally filtered before emission, so all or most logs are sent.
  - The AVS team is working on providing better filtering options in the future.
  - Meanwhile, customers can use third-party logic apps to filter and manage the data post-collection.

- **Use Cases**:
  - Syslog is primarily recommended for diagnostic purposes or when detailed log data is required to troubleshoot issues within the AVS environment.
  - It is not recommended to keep syslog enabled continuously due to cost and data volume.

- **Additional Notes**:
  - The speaker emphasized the importance of caution when enabling syslog.
  - Links and further resources will be provided in the presentation slides or afterwards for configuring syslog and third-party integrations.
